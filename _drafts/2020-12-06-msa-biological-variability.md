Last weekend I did a talk for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PALAEOTALKS2020/">PalaeoTalks series</a> organized by Gopesh Jha. It was a neat occasion and a great audience. I worked to highlight some of the emerging challenges for paleoanthropology in the next decade. One of those is the challenge of understanding the archaeological record in light of the presence of multiple species in Africa throughout the period of modern human origins. 

This topic inspired some questions that let me return briefly to the theme with a broader historical perspective. 

Archaeologists have long emphasized the regional variability of artifact assemblages attributed to the Middle Stone Age level of technical organization. Some assert that modern human cognitive evolution led to greater complexity of material culture, requiring greater and more reliable information transfer to maintain traditions. As traditions became more complicated, small differences in transmission fidelity would add up to large differences in the archaeological record. Greater interassemblage differentiation in this way of thinking is a consequence of greater information content. In this way, smarter humans left more variable archaeology. 

A different way of looking at the archaeological record is that variability in tools between regions may result from social isolation between regions. People who did not meet did not share tools. If populations were relatively socially isolated, there was probably little gene flow between them, meaning that archaeological variability between regions should correlate with biological variability between regions. 

These points of view emerged during the 1990s as archaeologists worked to integrate the MSA archaeological record into the out-of-Africa perspective on modern human origins. 




Eleanor Scerri and coworkers (2018) provided a commentary suggesting that both these factors interacted to produce MSA variability: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.05.005">"Did Our Species Evolve in Subdivided Populations across Africa, and Why Does It Matter?"</a>. This essay articulated one way of looking at the relationship of cognitive, social, and demographic influences on technology. 


At an extreme, some archaeologists proposed that MSA patterns of behavior emerged in a tiny, bottlenecked human population that gave rise to all later modern humans---a "speciation event". In this way of thinking, the onset of the MSA corresponds to a major loss of human biological diversity. 

In 2000, the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em> published an influential review of the African archaeological record by Sally McBrearty and Alison Brooks: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jhev.2000.0435">"The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior"</a>. Over the past 20 years the review has been cited more than 2800 times. The paper remains very relevant today. McBrearty and Brooks provided an 18-page table with brief accounts of the archaeological and fossil record at African sites. Their account took full advantage of advances during the 1980s and 1990s in understanding of the geological ages of many sites. 

The biggest impact of geochronology upon their thinking was the realization that some Middle Stone Age assemblages in Africa are much older than any Upper Paleolithic sites in Europe or the Levant. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was often assumed that the MSA was an African equivalent of the European Upper Paleolithic. By the 1990s it was clear that most MSA assemblages were older than any Upper Paleolithic assemblages, and . This left  


McBrearty and Brooks consistently used the "Acheulian" spelling throughout their paper. 

<blockquote>Archaeological remains are a good source of evidence for past behavior, and may help to clarify the nature of later Middle Pleistocene speciation events themselves. The most conspicuous behavioral event in the late Middle Pleistocene archaeological record of Africa is the disappearance of the Acheulian industry before 200 ka, and its replacement by diverse MSA traditions. Thus, it is to the late Acheulian and early MSA that we should look to understand the circumstances surrounding the origin of <em>H. sapiens</em>. This obvious fact is consistently overlooked because Europeâ€™s earliest modern human inhabitants, about 150,000 years later, were makers of Upper Paleolithic technology. Thus the origin of <em>H. sapiens</em> has been conflated with the origin of the Upper Paleolithic. The Acheulian contains large bifaces, while most MSA industries are characterized by smaller flake tools, sometimes made on flakes struck from prepared cores, a technology often referred to as Mode 3 (Clark, 1977). The abandonment of handaxes and cleavers for smaller flake tools represents the replacement of handheld by hafted implements and signals a profound technological reorganization.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To what extent can behavioral data help to resolve the issue of whether these species are sound taxonomic categories? How consistent are the archaeological associations of each group and how great are the behavioral or ecological differences among them? The correlations between archaeological industries and hominid taxa in Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene Africa are summarized in Table 2.</blockquote>



<blockquote>It is clear that the features diagnostic of physical modernity emerge in conjunction with MSA technologies. In this paper we present evidence to support the presence of modern human behaviors in subsaharan Africa at remote times far predating any such traces outside Africa. We contend that the appearance of modern behaviors accompanied or even preceded the appearance of <em>H. sapiens</em> during the African MSA, suggesting that the behaviors may perhaps have driven the anatomical changes seen in the fossils. We also suggest that these behaviors developed gradually over a substantial period of time and sporadically in different parts of the continent.</blockquote>





During the last decade, paleontologists and geneticists have made remarkable discoveries of species and population diversity in the later Middle Pleistocene of Africa. These new discoveries must lead to a new way of thinking about the variability of the archaeological record.
