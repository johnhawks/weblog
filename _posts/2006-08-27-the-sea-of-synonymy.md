R. D. Guthrie, from p. 3 of "Bison evolution and zoogeography in North America during the Pleistocene," Q Rev Biol 45:1-15, 1970: 
</p>

<blockquote>During the early history of Pleistocene paleontology in America it was not uncommon to give any horn core the status of a new species if it was slightly different from any other type that had been described; consequently the literature abounds with forms such as <i>Bison regius</i>, <i>B. angularis</i>, <i>B. oliverhayi</i>, <i>B. rotundus</i>, <i>B. californicus</i>, <i>B. ferox</i>, <i>B. texanus</i>, <i>B. taylori</i>, <i>B. pacificus</i>, <i>B. sylvestris</i>, and <i>B. kansensis</i>, which have since been lost in the sea of synonymy. </blockquote>
