<p>
Today I lectured on the earliest hominid samples for my graduate course on australopithecines. This is the first time I have been able to give a full lecture on the Late Miocene hominids up to <i>A. anamensis</i> since their discovery. The thing that struck me is that even if you study a set of fossils and literature for research, there are things that don't really strike you until you are standing in front of a full-screen slide projection talking about them. 
</p>

<p>
One of the interesting things was to see the juxtaposition of the Lothagam and Tabarin mandibles with the new <i>Ardipithecus</i> and other early hominid samples. It's worthwhile remembering that not that long a time ago, Lothagam was the earliest hominid, and was argued to fit within the range of variation of <i>A. afarensis</i> (Hill et al. 1992). Tabarin, likewise, was not specially distinguishable from the <i>A. afarensis</i> sample (Ward and Hill 1987). They undoubtedly remain so, but chronologically they make sense as part of the <i>Ardipithecus</i> sample, which raises the anatomical question: are they <i>Ardipithecus</i> or something very like it? The answers are out there, I set the graduate students on the problem, and I have every confidence they will come up with an answer in the next couple of weeks. 
</p>

<p>
Another observation is the very distinctive mandibular anatomy of <i>A. anamensis</i> The well-preserved mandibles all have very long postcanine tooth rows, certainly compared to the relatively narrow breadth of the dentition. Moreover, the mandibular symphysis is very long and slopes posteriorly to a greater extent than in later hominids (all this reviewed in Ward et al. 2001). This has a couple of interesting consequences. The first is that the mandible begins curving medially toward the symphysis relatively distally--around the first molars. This is exactly the morphology that was said to be hominid-like about <i>Ramapithecus</i>, and indeed the curvature itself is similar to later hominids. What is different about <i>A. anamensis</i> is the extent of the anterior dentition. This all tends to say that <i>A. afarensis</i> was substantially more orthognathic than earlier <i>A. anamensis</i>. A question is whether the other early hominids were similar to <i>A. anamensis</i> in this respect. 
</p>

<p>
As yet, none of the earlier hominid mandibles are sufficiently preserved to evaluate the symphyseal morphology or the shape of the anterior dentition. The maxilla of <i>Sahelanthropus</i> is sufficiently preserved in the Toumai specimen, but it badly needs reconstruction to say for sure what its shape is (Brunet et al. 2002). From the basal view, it appears more apelike in shape than in <i>A. afarensis</i>, but the lower maxilla appears rather less prognathic than in AL 444-2 or other <i>A. afarensis</i> remains, raising doubt as to whether the front of the face was really more projecting than in later hominids. 
</p>

<p>
The question left to answer with these missing observations is whether <i>A. anamensis</i> was intermediate between the earliest hominids and <i>A. africanus</i> in toothrow shape and its anterior dentition, or whether it diverges from both these samples. Its configuration appears unique at the moment, and seems to provide a distinctive combination of posterior tooth expansion, mandibular strengthening and buttressing, and the retention of a large anterior dentition. 
</p>

<p>
How much of a dental difference is there between <i>A. anamensis</i> and <i>Ardipithecus</i>? I ask this because one of the most distinctive differences between <i>A. afarensis</i> and <i>Ardipithecus</i> is the dm<sub>1</sub>, which is very apelike in the Aramis ARA-VP-1/129 mandibular fragment (White et al. 1994). The apelike morphology is a mesiodistally long tooth, without buccolingual expansion, and without the elaboration of occlusal topology such as a marked talonid basin. Early hominids have expanded deciduous molars, and the dm<sub>1</sub> in particular is quite molariform (as in the Taung mandible). But the morphology in <i>A. anamensis</i> is close to that described for <i>Ardipithecus</i>. The tooth is best preserved in the KNM-KP 34725 dentition (and is less well preserved but consistent with this form in KNM-KP 31712). The tooth is much longer mesiodistally than buccolingually, and it is narrower than any in the <i>A. afarensis</i> sample (Ward et al. 2001). The only notable difference between this tooth and the Aramis specimen is its larger size, being nearly 2 mm larger in both length and breadth, which makes it more similar in size to an <i>A. afarensis</i> tooth, though not in shape. 
</p>

<p>
What is lacking now is an appreciation of the probable level of variation among the dentitions within a single sample. Here, we face the problem of comparing multiple samples separated by hundreds of thousands of years, without even the possibility of a test of significance between them. For example, the mandibular premolars of <i>A. anamensis</i> are described by Ward and colleagues (2001) as being similar to <i>Ardipithecus</i> in having a unicuspid P<sub>3</sub> and a less expanded talonid on the P<sub>4</sub> compared to <i>A. afarensis</i>.  But the P<sub>3</sub> form is highly variable at the single site of Hadar, as the form of the upper canine shows substantial variation in only a few specimens at Laetoli and Hadar. If the earlier hominids are all fairly similar, is this to be interpreted as an important degree of similarity compared to later hominids? Is there any substantial evidence of multiple species here at all? Tough question (Ward et al. 2001 duck it by noting that descriptions of <i>Ardipithecus</i> and <i>Orrorin</i> are lacking). 
</p>

<p>
It is probably necessary to look into the quantification of nonmetric variation within dental samples of early hominids. This will be tough since there are really not enough teeth to create good seriations to examine character variation. But the diagnosis of <i>A. kadabba</i> (Haile-Selassie 2001) is an interesting case study in the delineation of minor morphological details. In this instance, only one specimen of each potential subspecies (now species, and one specimen published, although surely the author saw a broader sample of unpublished remains) were compared with each other. Each difference was tabulated as part of the subspecies diagnosis (without direct consideration of whether the traits might vary in earlier or later species or samples). How likely is it that two fossils within a sample will differ in the presence of a shallow mesial fovea on P<super>3</super>? Or in the diagnosis of the species (Haile-Selassie et al. 2004), how likely is it that two specimens will differ as <i>A. kadabba</i> and <i>O. tugenensis</i> evidently do by a more circular canine shape in occlusal view? This is the important kind of question for testing the validity of the diagnosis, but it is as yet unanswered.
