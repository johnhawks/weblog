An interesting passage from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1178158">the horse genome paper</a>: 

<blockquote>We were unable to phylogenetically separate <i>E. przewalskii</i> from the domesticated horses, despite its different karyotype (2N = 66 versus 2N = 64 for the domesticated horse), which is in agreement with recent findings (16), whereas the donkey (<i>E. africanus</i>) is clearly a distinct taxon (fig. S9, table S14, and SOM text). This suggests that either intermixing of <i>E. przewalskii</i> and <i>E. caballus</i> occurred after subspecies separation or that <i>E. przewalskii</i> is recently derived from <i>E. caballus.</i></blockquote>

My first thought on seeing they'd completed a horse genome draft was that this would be really useful as a model for understanding the origin and dispersal of a new species -- the idea being that we know a lot archaeologically about horse domestication, and introgression from the wild progenitor species would have been limited to a certain range that we can sort of predict. However, that passage makes it sound not-so-simple. 

The paper also mentions the "widespread synteny" of human and horse genomes, which I suppose means there are different chromosomal pairings that stand out because the other known non-primate mammalian genomes are on different long branches (dog, cow, pig, mouse, elephant, etc.). We've got quite a decent sampling of long-diverged mammalian orders.
