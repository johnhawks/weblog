Many of us use sickle cell as an example in classes. I always do so while noting the progress that has been made in treating the condition in Westernized contexts -- otherwise students walk away with a very misleading view of today's medical situation for patients expressing the sickle trait. 

The news today is full of a new advance in treatment -- it's stem cell transplants in bone marrow, and the new aspect is a better protocol for adult sufferers (children have benefited from these transplants for some time). 

I'll link to <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/361/24/2309">the research paper's abstract</a> instead of a news story:

<blockquote>Conclusions: A protocol for nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation that includes total-body irradiation and treatment with alemtuzumab and sirolimus can achieve stable, mixed donorrecipient chimerism and reverse the sickle cell phenotype. </blockquote>

You've got to like a treatment where the desired outcome is "chimerism."
