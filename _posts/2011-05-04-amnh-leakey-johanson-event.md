The American Museum of Natural History has arranged an event featuring Richard Leakey and Don Johanson, which is happening tomorrow evening: <a href="http://www.amnh.org/calendar/event/Human-Evolution-and-Why-It-Matters:-A-Conversation-with-Leakey-and-Johanson/">"Human Evolution and Why It Matters: A Conversation with Leakey and Johanson"</a>. 

<blockquote>Celebrating decades of groundbreaking exploration in East Africa, renowned paleoanthropologists Donald Johanson and Richard Leakey will share the stage to discuss the overwhelming evidence for evolution in the hominid fossil record and why understanding our evolutionary history is so important.

Known for such landmark discoveries as "Lucy" (Johanson) and "Turkana Boy" (Leakey), the work of these two scientists has produced much of the fossil evidence which forms our understanding of human evolution.

Looking back over careers spanning 40-plus years, these men will share the stories behind their monumental finds and offer a look at what's ahead in human evolutionary research.</blockquote>


<a href="http://www.amnh.org/live/">AMNH site will be live-streaming the event</a>, starting at 6:30 pm EDT, Thursday, May 5. 

A <a href="http://www.amnh.org/calendar/event/Student-Town-Hall-Event-with-Donald-Johanson-and-Richard-Leakey/">"student town hall event"</a> with the two scientists speaking to students from five schools was scheduled to be held today.

It's such an interesting story! I find it exceptional that they are reprising the event.
