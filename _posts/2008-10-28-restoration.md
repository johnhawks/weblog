I found myself touched by <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27408472/">this story</a> about the restoration of Raphael's "Madonna of the Goldfinch." And glad that some people make it their life's work to preserve and restore the past:

<blockquote>"I am just a technician," the chief restorer of the project said with humility. "But, yes, I think I probably know this painting almost better than Raphael. He looked at it, sure, but all these years I have been looking at it with a microscope."</blockquote>

<blockquote>She lifted the painting out of a wooden box with the confidence of someone who has done it many times -- like a mechanic changing a tire -- but then gently positioned it at the center of an easel with the love of a mother adjusting her child's scarf on a winter day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To think of it, I have spent more time with him than with my daughter," said Riitano, a 30-year veteran of restoration.</blockquote>
