<blockquote>MANUAL labour is becoming more and more difficult for Japan's aging farmers, prompting a Tokyo professor to devise a high-tech solution: mechanise the bodies of the farmers themselves.</blockquote>

We have a course on the books here called "Human dimensions of robotics." It hasn't been taught for many, many years. I imagine it began as a labor relations course in the 1970s, when robots were becoming a big issue in factory work. Anyway, I've often thought it may be time to revive the title, with a very different focus.
