It's hard to improve on the headline of <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22611275/">this story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Why chimps eat dirt</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Sabrina] Krief collected the dirt along with leaves from one of the chimps' favorite foods, the <i>Trichilia rubescens</i> plant. She found that when eaten alone, the leaves had no pharmacological effect, but when combined with soil, the mixture had clear anti-malarial properties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Scientists previously suspected that animals might eat dirt when stressed or as a source of missing minerals. This new result is the first suggestion that the combination of soil and other foods could have health benefits, Krief said. </blockquote>

<p>
The story also discusses the use of high-kaolinite dirts as antidiarrheal treatments in local peoples -- kaolinite being the nameworthy ingredient of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaopectate">Kaopectate</a>, although it is no longer used in that medication.

Anyway, this is a good excuse to use the word "geophagy." Great word.
