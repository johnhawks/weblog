<blockquote>This map was constructed by sorting roughly 800,000 published papers into 776 different scientific paradigms (shown as pale circular nodes) based on how often the papers were cited together by authors of other papers. Links (curved black lines) were made between the paradigms that shared papers, then treated as rubber bands, holding similar paradigms nearer one another when a physical simulation forced every paradigm to repel every other; thus the layout derives directly from the data. Larger paradigms have more papers; node proximity and darker links indicate how many papers are shared between two paradigms. Flowing labels list common words unique to each paradigm, large labels general areas of scientific inquiry.</blockquote>

It takes some doing to find all the paleoanthropology-related "paradigms" on the map -- they literally are sprinkled from one end ("Social Science") to the other ("Earth Science"). It's very pretty, but the "flowing" keywords for each "paradigm" are sort of hard to read -- half of them being upside-down and all.

Just try to find "Australopithecus." I dare you!
