This is the time of year that a lot of people are buying gifts for friends and family. Some of my readers have long been in the habit of using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Amazon purchase links</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=johnhawksanth-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which pay my server and domain registration fees. A few have even gotten their departments to run Amazon purchases through the weblog -- anything you buy from Amazon, if you go through my link it costs you nothing more but gives my site a small percentage of the purchase. 

I always thought that people would click my book links. Actually, the fact is that one of my readers who buys bulk pet food pays two months of server fees a year! I never guessed that one person's dogs and cats could make such a difference. 

So many thanks to everyone!

And if you're not an Amazon shopper but want to make a small donation, the PayPal donation link at right has been a great addition this year.
