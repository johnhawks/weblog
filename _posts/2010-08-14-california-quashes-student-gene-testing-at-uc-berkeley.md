<i>LA Times</i>: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-dna-20100813,0,5927846.story">"UC Berkeley adjusts freshman orientation's gene-testing program."</a>

Where "adjusts" means the state's Public Health Department blocked them from reporting any test results to individual students, so they took the 1000 saliva samples and made a big blind pool to have something to talk about during their orientation program. 

The thing that bothers me now: 

<blockquote>The state Senate Education Committee on Wednesday defeated a bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Chris Norby (R-Fullerton), that would have restricted UC's and Cal State's ability to seek students' DNA.</blockquote>

One wonders what else the bill contained. Will DNA samples be required for university admission in the future?
