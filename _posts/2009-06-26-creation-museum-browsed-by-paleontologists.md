<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31569042/ns/technology_and_science-science/">Seventy-some paleontologists took a field trip to the Creation Museum.</a> Good premise for a story, but hilarity does not ensue:

<blockquote>"The real purpose of the museum visit is to give some of my colleagues an opportunity to sense how they're being portrayed," said Arnold Miller, a professor of paleontology at the University of Cincinnati, which is hosting the conference. "They're being demonized, I feel, in this museum as people who are responsible for all the ills of society."</blockquote>
