Speaking of super-predators from the past, <i>Natural History Magazine</i> has <a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/090509-marsupial-lion.html">a short article describing Australian rock art</a> that may depict the extinct marsupial lion, <i>Thylacoleo carnifex</i>: 

<blockquote>Kim Akerman, an independent anthropologist based in Tasmania, says the painting unmistakably depicts a marsupial lion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It shows the requisite catlike muzzle, large forelimbs, and heavily clawed front paws. And it portrays the animal with a striped back, a tufted tail, and pointed ears.</blockquote>

The image is described <a href="http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/akerman1/">in a brief and readable report in the March issue of <i>Antiquity</i></a>.
