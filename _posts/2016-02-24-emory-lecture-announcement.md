This is a short-notice update, but if you are in the Atlanta area, I'll be giving a lecture Thursday afternoon, February 25 for the Center for Mind, Brain and Culture at Emory University. The flyer is below:

As noted, the lecture is at 4:00 pm in room 101 of White Hall. 

For those of you in the New Orleans area, I am giving a talk at Tulane University next Friday, March 4. I'll post all the details when I have them.
