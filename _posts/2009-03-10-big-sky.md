I'm in Big Sky, Montana the next couple of days. Here's a shot:

That's a nighttime shot with my Canon 20D, 50mm f/1.4 lens at 1600 ISO.

I'm giving a plenary talk at the IEEE Aerospace Conference tomorrow afternoon. It's a great opportunity in a great place, and I'm having a great time. Last night I heard Lisa Randall give one of the other plenary talks, and I have to say that the organizers have put together a really cool program. 

I'm not really a skier, but I'm enjoying the mountains, and I'm planning on doing some snowshoeing together with a little photography.
