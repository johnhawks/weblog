The Friends of Darwin blog notes that <a href="http://blog.friendsofdarwin.com/2008/01/20080121/">the terms "lumpers" and "splitters" in taxonomy go back to Darwin's time</a>. The example is <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1740.html">a letter Darwin received from Hewett Cottrell Watson</a>. A nice piece of trivia.
