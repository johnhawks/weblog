A reader tipped me off to this Michael Balter news item: <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/01/new-german-israeli-center-will.html">"New German-Israeli Center Will Research Archaeology and Anthropology"</a>. 

<blockquote>The new Max Planck Weizmann Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology, as it will be called, won't have a new building. Instead, the money will fund up to 10 postdocs or graduate students in each city, says anthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. It will also support equipment and infrastructure such as the rental of additional lab space in Leipzig and the kitting out of existing space at the Weizmann Institute. Hublin and archaeologist Steve Weiner of the Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science at the Weizmann will co-direct the new center.</blockquote>

Looks like an ambitious cooperation between two strong institutes.
