For those heavy-traveling anthropologists in the audience, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5312995/power+line-exploit-logs-your-keystrokes-using-outlets-lasers">Gizmodo explains</a> how airport sockets may allow goons to swipe your password:</a>

<blockquote>The technique is a form of keylogging, which is nothing new, but in an interesting twist hackers have figured out a non-traditional way to replicate the process using nothing but the electric signals created with each keystroke. Oh, and even if you aren't plugged into a socket, they they can still log keystrokes remotely using a laser.</blockquote>

I'm too poor to pay for airport wireless, so all they'll get from me are Mathematica scripts and blog entries.
