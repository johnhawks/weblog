<i>Ouranopithecus macedoniensis</i> (called by some <i>Graecopithecus</i>) is from the Late Miocene of Greece, around 8 million years old. Based on its facial and dental anatomy, <i>Ouranopithecus</i> is clearly a dryopithecine, but it is not clear if it may be particularly related to either humans or some living ape lineage. The morphology of the male skull appears similar to living gorillas, with a large and broad face, prominent supraorbital torus, and square-shaped orbits. These similarities may reflect nothing more than a relatively large body size, though a close relationship with gorillas is a possibility.

Some of the features of <i>Ouranopithecus</i> are similar to hominids. Most notably, like some other Late Miocene remains, the canines are relatively smaller in size than in many apes, especially in females. With fairly thick molar enamel and low cusps, the molar teeth are not gorilla-like, but instead are more similar to later hominids. Sexual dimorphism is substantial between the teeth, however, and males have large canines and shearing lower premolars.
