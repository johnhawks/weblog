Michael E. Smith has <a href="http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2010/04/how-to-give-bad-presentation-at.html">some suggestions after going to the SAA meetings</a>: 

<blockquote><b>How to give a bad presentation at a professional conference</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>I have always been amazed at the low quality of many presentations at these meetings, starting at the first one I attended as an undergraduate.
