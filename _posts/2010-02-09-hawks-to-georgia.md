This week I'm travelling to the University of Georgia to participate in the week of Darwin Day activities they have going there. It's <a href="http://darwinday.uga.edu/">a great program</a>, full of interesting lectures and events. 

I'll be talking about Neandertal genetics on Thursday, February 11, in the Reception Hall of the Tate Center at 3:30 in the afternoon. If you're in the Athens area -- heck, if you're anywhere in Georgia! -- I'd love to see you there!

If you can't make it on Thursday, there will be another really cool lecture Friday at noon, in the same place, by Ren&eacute; Bobe, expert in the field of paleoecology and human evolution. His title: "Lucy, I'm Home! Humanity's Six-million-Year Journey". And on Wednesday evening, <a href="http://www.trollart.com/">artist Ray Troll</a> will give his perspective on "An Artists View of the History of Life". 

Meanwhile, here in Madison <a href="http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~museum/DarwinDay/Darwin_Day/Home.html">the annual Darwin Day event</a> will be held on Saturday the 13th, in the Microbial Sciences Building. If you weren't there last year, well Microbial Sciences is a really beautiful new building, with a huge atrium and central auditorium. My students and many other biology and evolution-related labs on campus will have displays and posters up for all ages, from 10 to 3:30.

At the same time, a lecture program and panel discussion will be running. The featured lecturer is Jonathan Losos, whose work understanding the incredible ecological diversity of <i>Anolis</i> lizards in the Caribbean has become one of the most important case studies in ecology and evolution today. There will be a workshop for teachers featuring activities centered around these lizards, it's a tremendous opportunity to bring current biology research into education.
