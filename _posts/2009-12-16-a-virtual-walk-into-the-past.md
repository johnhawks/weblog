Via a reader: 

<blockquote><a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=28752:sterkfontein-caves-on-street-view&catid=49:audio-visual">Sterkfontein Caves on Street View</a></blockquote>

It's not there yet, but Google is adding a gaggle of World Heritage Sites to the Street View feature, and Sterkfontein will be among them. An interesting detail:

<blockquote>Where access by car is not possible, Google uses its custom-made 'trike'  a three-wheeled bike mounted with a camera  to take the images. It will soon be used to collect imagery of the Sterkfontein Caves in SA.</blockquote>

Now, if they will just take us into the Silberberg Grotto...
