I'm getting a lot of hits this month on a post from last year, <a href="http://atapuerca/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/foxp2_krause_el_sidron_2007.html">"The amazing talking Neandertals"</a>. Don't know why....

There have been a couple of really informative papers in the last month about Neandertal genetics, I'll see if I can't get some information up about them soon.
