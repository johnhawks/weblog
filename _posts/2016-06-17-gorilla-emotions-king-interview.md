The <em>Pacific Standard</em> is running a nice interview with anthropologist Barbara King, by Francie Diep: <a href="https://psmag.com/how-do-gorillas-grieve-b285c6b30d84#.cg1tmhrh9">"How Do Gorillas Grieve?"</a>. It touches on the recent killing of the gorilla, Harambe, at the Cincinnati Zoo, but broadens to consider the emotional lives of gorillas. 

<blockquote>Q: What you’re saying reminds me that humans also evolved things like maternal love and aggressive responses, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t thinking, obviously.</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>A: That’s exactly right. I do not think it’s anthropomorphic to talk about grief in gorillas. Anthropomorphism is a projection of human qualities onto apes. Why would we say that grief is a human thing? I don’t think it is. I think it’s an animal thing, at least for some animals.</blockquote>
