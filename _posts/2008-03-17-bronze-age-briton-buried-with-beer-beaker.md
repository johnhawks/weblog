This seems like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/kent/7300232.stm">a fitting St. Patrick's Day story:</a>

<blockquote>Canterbury Archaeological Trust said the curled-up skeleton was an example of a "Beaker" burial because of the pottery vessel placed at its feet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Education officer Marion Green said the "beautifully decorated" pot could have been "a type of beer mug".</blockquote>

<blockquote>She said tests on beakers from other sites suggested Bronze Age man was brewing a type of beer from grain.</blockquote>

<p>
No word on whether the beer was green.
