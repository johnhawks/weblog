<i>Nature</i> is running <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/50_science_blogs.html">a feature on the 50 top popular science blogs</a>, and the Technorati rank here puts me at number 14! 
</p>

<p>
Maybe they missed a few, and of course there are other things besides the number of links to consider, but I have to say it's pretty exciting to be mentioned along with some of the other great blogs.

If you're here linked from <i>Nature</i>, welcome! I have some great stuff coming up in the next few weeks as I'm catching up from my trip and typing up some notes.
