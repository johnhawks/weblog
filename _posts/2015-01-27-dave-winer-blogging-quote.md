From Dave Winer: <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/01/25/aNoteAboutBlogging.html">"A note about blogging"</a>.

<blockquote>Some people seem to feel the need to justify blogging, blogging is still alive they say, but it's actually more than alive blogging is a cultural fixture. Thriving. </blockquote>
