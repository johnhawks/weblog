The headline of this <em>Guardian</em> story really says it all: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/28/nazi-buddha-statue-carved-from-meteorite">"Priceless Tibetan Buddha statue looted by Nazis was carved from meteorite"</a>. 

<blockquote>The 1,000-year-old carving, which is 24cm high and weighs 10kg, depicts the god Vaisravana, the Buddhist King of the North, and is known as the Iron Man statue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was stolen before the second world war during a pillage of Tibet by Hitler's SS, who were searching for the origins of the Aryan race.</blockquote>

I can have only one reaction to that, really: "It is something that man was not meant to disturb. Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth."
