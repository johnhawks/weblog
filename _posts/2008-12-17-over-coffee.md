GRETCHEN: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/social/tv/science-programs-crichton-wired-2008.html"><i>Crazy Like a Fox?</i></a> Where do you think you are, 1984? 

GOODWIN (age 3): Nineteen eighty FOUR?! I HATE nineteen eighty four!

ME: Why do you hate 1984, Goodwin? 

GOODWIN: Because I like nineteen ninety one and three.
