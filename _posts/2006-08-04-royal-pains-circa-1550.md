Here's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14156262/">some good news</a> in medicine:
</p>

<blockquote>A 450-year-old piece of Charles V's pinkie lends support to the theory that it was gout that led one of the most powerful rulers of all time to abdicate, Spanish researchers report.</blockquote>

<p>
Thus solving a complete medical mystery! 
</p>

<p>
Er...
</p>

<blockquote>Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, whose empire stretched across Europe and included Spanish America, was diagnosed with gout by his doctors in early adulthood. </blockquote>

<p>
Oh well, hopefully with this research, no monarch will ever again have to abdicate because of gout.
</p>

<p>
Er...
</p>

<blockquote>Gout has long been associated with rich diets and alcohol. According to the researchers, Charles V had a big appetite, especially for meat, and drank large amounts of beer and wine.</blockquote>

<p>
Stop, Prince William, before it's too late!
