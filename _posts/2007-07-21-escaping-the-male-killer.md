At the moment, our yard here has many more butterflies than the "butterfly garden" at the zoo. That's mostly attributable to the zoo's complete lack of milkweed (<i>Asclepias</i>), which we've had going strong for around three weeks, supplemented by a huge number of coneflowers (<i>Echinacea</i>). After a quick burst of painted ladies, the monarchs have settled in. We've had phlox for a few days now, so we'll be watching for tiger swallowtails. 
</p>

<p>
So I like <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19733274/">this story</a> about the rapid response to selection among Blue Moon butterflies in Samoa: 
</p>

<blockquote>Sylvain Charlat of the University of California, Berkeley, and the University College London, along with colleagues, studied the sex ratios of <i>Hypolimnas bolina</i> butterflies on the Samoan islands of Upolu and Savaii, where males had dwindled to 1 percent of the populations in 2001.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The likely culprit was a male-killing parasite, <i>Wolbachia</i>, which lives inside the butterfly's reproductive cells, preferably female sex cells. With a female host, <i>Wolbachia</i> can hitch a ride to the next generation aboard the mother's eggs. Since males are "useless" for the bacteria's survival, the parasite kills male embryos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But the male butterflies found a way to stealthily overcome the parasites. At the beginning of 2006, the scientists found the males made up about 40 percent of Upolu's butterfly population.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Savaii, females still dominated the Blue Moon butterfly population (99 percent) at the start of 2006, but by the year's end, males made up nearly 40 percent.</blockquote>

<p>
  <i>Wolbachia</i> may be the best parasites in nature, judging by the diversity of strategies that they exhibit. Killing males to direct resources toward females is the least of these. Here's a passage from a 1995 article by Stephen Hart: <br />
  
<blockquote>Entomologists had thought that parthenogenetic wasps represented a quirk of nature -- until geneticist Richard Stouthamer of the Agricultural University in Wageningen, the Netherlands, reported in the April 1990 <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> that he had "cured" parthenogenetic wasps with a dose of antibiotic. Tetracycline exorcises a parthenogenetic female, allowing her to lay viable female and male eggs. Her offspring can then go on to form a sexually reproducing population (Hart 1995:4).</blockquote>

<p>
The culprit was <i>Wolbachia</i>, of course, which can spur unfertilized eggs to develop. You may pause to consider whether this is good or bad for the wasps (clearly, it's bad for the <i>male</i> wasps!). But for the females, it leaves them 100 percent related to their offspring. <br />
  <br />
The rapid response to the high infection rate is quite expected based on the mechanism of male-killing, as long as the few remaining males are <i>necessary</i>, their genes will be represented in <i>all</i> the next generation. So it's an enormous reproductive advantage, in this case causing an allele to go from near zero to 40 percent in only 10 generations. 
</p>

<p>
Still, it raises that question again -- who's better off here, the lucky males or the <i>Wolbachia?</i>

<p>
UPDATE (7/21/2007): A tiger swallowtail yesterday -- a dark morph female, which is the first of those we've had around here.
