Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/blue-plate-crayon-2009.jpg" height="333" width="400" alt="Blue plate, with fork" />
</div>

The kids had a friend over this morning, so we had a little crayon session. Here are the remains of Gretchen's coffee cake. I haven't really tried to work with crayons forever -- it's easy to forget how hard they are to control. 

I generally save really poor-quality jpegs for the blog. With the pencil or ink drawings it doesn't make much difference, and I don't mind if they're a little ugly -- I'm paying for the bandwidth, after all. But the crayon scan really loses vibrancy in the jpeg, and I haven't figured out a way to compress it without losing that brightness. 

OK, what am I complaining about? It's crayon!
