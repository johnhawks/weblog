Conservation biologist Eleanor Sterling is running <a href="http://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/a-long-journey-to-vietnam/">a blog of field notes from a survey for langurs in Vietnam</a>, in the <i>NY Times</i> "Scientist at Work" blog zone. 

<blockquote>Vietnam harbors a diversity of primates  almost a quarter of all the primate species found in Asia  ranging from the woolly, diminutive loris species that only come out at night  to the long-armed and graceful gibbons famous for their elaborate duets; to the gregarious, stout-bodied macaques; and, of course, leaf-eating monkeys that are the focus of our study!</blockquote>
