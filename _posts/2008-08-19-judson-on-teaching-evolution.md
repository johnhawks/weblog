Olivia Judson <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/opinion/13judson.html">editorializes on the value of teaching evolution</a>:

<blockquote>[A] failure to consider the evolution of other species may result in a failure of our efforts to preserve them. And, perhaps, to preserve ourselves from diseases, pests and food shortages. In short, evolution is far from being a remote and abstract subject. A failure to teach it may leave us unprepared for the challenges ahead.</blockquote>
