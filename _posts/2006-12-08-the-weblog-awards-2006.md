I've been nominated for <a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_science_blog.php">a Weblog Award</a>, in the category of Best Science Blog. It's really exciting to be nominated! Of course, there's no prize for winning...
</p>

<p>
Voting <a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_science_blog.php">is now open</a>, and will be open until December 15. It looks like people <a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/best_science_blog.php">can vote</a> once every 24 hours. 
</p>

<p>
To me, that sounds a little obsessive. But I figure, if people will call in for <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=amusement&id=3471417">John O'Hurley</a>, then why not? 
</p>

<p>
Speaking of obsessive, the site uses Flash for its voting mechanism. Most people have it installed on their systems for one thing or another -- it seems that most commercial sites use it these days. But if you don't, please don't install it just for this; it's not worth the time!

And if you've never heard of some of the other nominees, you might want to check them out -- there are some really interesting and compelling blogs there!
