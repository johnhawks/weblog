A <a href="http://sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/33933/title/Loud_and_clear">story</a> in <i>Science News</i> by writer Tia Ghose, about the hearing capacities of the Atapuerca/Sima de los Huesos people, has been making the rounds, including <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/13/006251&from=rss">Slashdot</a>. I've been working on this question of hearing evolution (and my AAPA paper this spring was on the subject), so I don't have a lot to say. But if you've never heard about this before, the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403595101">original study by Ignacio Mart&iacute;nez and colleagues</a>, has been out since 2004. 

The results are quite clear: the Atapuerca middle ears (including the ossicles and shape of the canal) have a sound transmission potential that is maximal in the frequency range used by human speech, a range that chimpanzee middle ears do not amplify well. That seems pretty likely to indicate co-evolution of human auditory and vocal capabilities in the time before 500,000 years ago. Does that mean language? It certainly seems likely to mean <i>some</i> kind of vocal communication not shared with other hominoids, but that need not include every element of present-day human language. 

Why is it news now? I suppose it's probably because Mart&iacute;nez et al. recently presented their research at the Acoustic Society of America.  <a href="">another paper on the research</a>, in the <i>Journal of the Acoustic Society of America</i>. The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.2934784">abstract is available online</a>.
