Bizarrely, I'm now listening to the voice of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004804/">Drew Carey</a> telling me about Neanderthals. It's on <i>Prehistoric Planet</i>, which is one of the Discovery Kids shows. This particular Neanderthal, who looks like an outtake from "Walking with Cavemen," is being charged by a wooly rhinoceros. 
</p>

<p>
Yeaoww! The rhino just gored him!
</p>

<p>
Oh, yep, they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_Planet"><i>are</i> the Neanderthals</a> from "Walking with Cavemen." "Prehistoric Planet" is a repackaged version with new narration for kids. 
</p>

<p>
Now a bunch of mammoths are just walking along the edge of a very high cliff. This seems like a critical error of mammoth judgement. 
</p>

<p>
And the Neanderthals are waiting with blazing firebrands.

<blockquote>It's risky getting right up in your prey's face like this. Especially when <i>your prey has tusks!</i></blockquote>

<p>
It's an interestingly jumbled ending, with Neandertals going extinct because "they can't adapt to their changing world," the mammoths going extinct -- 19,000 years later -- because it gets too warm for them, and Cro-Magnons having a happy ending as they become ... <i>us!</i> All temperature, no killing spree. Don't you see, you just <i>have to be able to change!</i>

<p>
Well, it didn't keep Goodwin's attention, but then he's only two.
