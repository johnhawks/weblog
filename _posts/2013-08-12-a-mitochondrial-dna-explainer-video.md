<em>mathbionerd</em> author Melissa Wilson Sayres has put together a nice animated explainer about how mtDNA coalescence happens and why mtDNA is not the complete picture of genetic variation: <a href="http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2013/08/y-and-mtdna-are-not-adam-and-eve-part-2.html">"Y and mtDNA are not Adam and Eve: Part 2 - What it means to be the Most Recent Common Ancestor"</a>.

<blockquote><strong>1. One person (or two people) did not have the ancestral state of all of our DNA.</strong> The person whose cells housed the common mtDNA ancestor (or Y ancestor) also had all of the other chromosomes (1-22 and X), but did not house the common ancestor of each of these chromosomes. These non-sex chromosomes are a lot more complicated. This touches on why it is also misleading to refer to the common ancestor of genetic "males" versus "females." Genetic females are not only their mtDNA - we also have 22 non-sex chromosomes, and two X chromosomes! Genetic males are not only their Y (and mtDNA), they also have 22 non-sex chromosomes and one X chromosome! Because the non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) can swap DNA, and are inherited through both the sperm and the egg, they much more complicated history than the Y and mtDNA.</blockquote>
