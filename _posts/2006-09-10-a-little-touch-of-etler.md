I found out from a reader this morning that Dennis Etler <a href="http://sinanthropus.blogspot.com/">has a blog called "Sinanthropus"</a> -- and it's excellent! If you haven't seen his long-standing website, <a href="http://www.chineseprehistory.org/">"The Fossil Evidence for Human Evolution in China"</a>, you should check that out too. Both are full of insights!

Oh, and the number of hominid-inspired blog names is quickly decreasing, so start now if you want one. I happen to think that "Cyphanthropus" would be a cool blog name. For someone a little bit self-absorbed, there's always "Primigenius"...
