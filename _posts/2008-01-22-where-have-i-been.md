This is one of those days! The semester is starting, all the students and faculty are driving back to the University, every student yearning to make it to that early morning class, and <b>WHAM</b>, 7 inches of snow. Leading to the longest commute ever.

In the meantime, I've been slow updating this week because I'm doing a lot of work on the back-end. You'll see some changes in the site as I roll out the new system over the next few weeks. Overhauling a site like this one takes quite a bit of work, but in the end there will be some new functionality and better support for some of the newer features, like the interviews.

This also marks the beginning of my course, "Genes and human populations." It has been two years since I taught it, and I've realized that almost the entire course will consist of new material that didn't exist last time! This is an incredibly rapidly changing field, and that's exciting. If you're following the blog, you'll see some of the summaries and assessments of the field of human genetics and how genes relate to our lives.

Oh, and there may be some new hominids to look at, too. It will be an interesting few months, to be sure.
