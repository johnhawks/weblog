The Associated Press profiles Richard Leakey: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47577163/ns/technology_and_science-science/">"Scientist: Evolution debate will soon be history"</a>. The article gives a bit of Leakey's biography and discusses how he came to join the faculty at Stony Brook University and his current fundraising efforts for the Turkana Basin Institute. The "evolution debate" quote comes from the interview:

<blockquote>"If you don't like the word evolution, I don't care what you call it, but life has changed. You can lay out all the fossils that have been collected and establish lineages that even a fool could work up. So the question is why, how does this happen? It's not covered by Genesis. There's no explanation for this change going back 500 million years in any book I've read from the lips of any God."</blockquote>
