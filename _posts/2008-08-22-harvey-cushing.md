At Neurophilosophy, a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2008/08/harvey_cushing_photo_journal.php">cool post</a> on the photorecord of early neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing: 

<blockquote>Before Cushing began his career, brain tumours were considered to be inoperable, and the mortality rate for any surgical procedure which involved opening the skull was around 90%. Early in his career, Cushing dramatically reduced the mortality rate for neurosurgery to less than 10%, and by the time of his retirement in 1937, he had successfully removed more than 2,000 tumours.</blockquote>
