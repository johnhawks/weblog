Gina Kolata reports on a surprising result for a long-term study of diet and exercise in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/health/in-study-weight-loss-did-not-prevent-heart-attacks-in-diabetics.html">"Diabetes Study Ends Early With a Surprising Result"</a>.

<blockquote>The study randomly assigned 5,145 overweight or obese people with Type 2 diabetes to either a rigorous diet and exercise regimen or to sessions in which they got general health information. The diet involved 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day for those weighing less than 250 pounds and 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day for those weighing more. The exercise program was at least 175 minutes a week of moderate exercise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But 11 years after the study began, researchers concluded it was futile to continue  the two groups had nearly identical rates of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths.</blockquote>

One expert quoted in the article thinks that the large effects of smoking cessation, statin drugs and blood pressure medications may swamp the small effect of diet and exercise. <em>Swamp the small effect of diet and exercise on type 2 diabetes in obese patients?</em> Wow.
