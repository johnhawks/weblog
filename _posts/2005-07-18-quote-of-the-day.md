<p>
I have to say I love this quote: 
</p>

<blockquote>[T]he Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones. It ended because it was time for a re-think about how we live.</blockquote>

<p>
It's ascribed to architect William McDonough by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4682011.stm">this BBC article</a>, which describes new trends in city-building being tried out in China. I usually am skeptical of futurists because they tend to get the past wrong, and this quote certainly isn't quite right -- don't know that Bronze-Agers were really doing a "re-think." But it's a million-dollar analogy.
