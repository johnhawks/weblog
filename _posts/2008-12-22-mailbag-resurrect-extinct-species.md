In today's mail, this question: 

<blockquote>Stupid question that I wish you would address: Are the tissue samples left from recently extinct species such as the Auroch, passenger pigeon, moa, dodo etc etc of sufficient quality to use it to resurrect the species? I would much rather see an Auroch than a pet cat cloned. Of course a wooly mammoth or Neanderthal would be even more interesting  but also more problematic. </blockquote>


My reply: 

<blockquote>It seems that those pursuing the idea of such resurrection are more interested in constructing artificial chromosomes. Once the technology is sufficient to do that, all you need is a genome sequence of the extinct organism and a suitable (closely related) host species to carry the pregnancy&mdash;of course with the attendant possible problems of immunocompatibility, etc. </blockquote>

<blockquote>So, the barrier now is not the amount of tissue or the availability of genomic data, both of which seem to be sufficient for any recently extinct organism. </blockquote>

I also mentioned the topic <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/neanderchimp-baby-cloning-2008.html">last month</a>, after the <i>NY Times</i> carried an article about mammoth cloning. The idea raised there by George Church (which he thought would "alarm a minimal number of people" was constructing a Neandertal genome from a chimpanzee prototype. Is he imagining that people aren't ooked out by a Neandertal baby C-sectioned from a female chimpanzee? 

OK, so <i>I'm</i> ooked out. Meanwhile, I think you're going to want to construct a <i>diploid</i> genome, not two identical ones, because there are going to be some recessive lethals in there. So it takes more knowledge of variation than a single genome, and ideally quite a bit more. That's a limit too.
