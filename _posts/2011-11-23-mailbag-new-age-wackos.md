<blockquote>While looking for something else on youtube I stumbled on a video by a New Age wacko named [name redacted]. Part of his schtick is the claim that human DNA is changing rapidly and building up to some kind of big transformation in Dec 2012. I suppose it is inevitable that one's work can be used by anyone, but I thought you might like to know that yours is being invoked by this charlatan.</blockquote>

Thank you so much, I appreciate it. You're right, many, many people are out there finding ways to misappropriate our work -- used to be mainly creationists but lately I have more and more New Age-types.
