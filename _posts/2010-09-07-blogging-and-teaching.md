If you're an instructor curious about how to introduce blogs in your courses, you may want to read <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuroanthropology/2010/09/06/students-and-neuroanthropology-the-power-of-the-post/">this post by Daniel Lende</a> at the new Neuroanthropology. He describes his experiences getting students to broaden senior theses, community-based research and even exams.
