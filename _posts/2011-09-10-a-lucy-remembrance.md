The CNN medical blog (associated with Sanjay Gupta) is running a short piece by Don Johanson, which may be of interest: <a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/08/lucy-discoverer-why-i-study-human-evolution/">"'Lucy' discoverer: Why I study human evolution"</a>.

<blockquote>My deep commitment to understand the origins of humankind was ignited when I read Thomas Henry Huxleys 1863 book "Mans Place in Nature." The core idea that gripped my teenage mind was the suggestion that humans and African apes shared a common ancestor that roamed Africa millions of years ago.</blockquote>

I think if you're a teenager reading Huxley, you're already in the right tail of the distribution for "human evolution interest"!
