For the next week, the <a href="http://www.justscience.net/">Just Science</a> aggregator (<a href="feed:/<i>www.justscience.net</i>?feed=rss2">feed</a>) will be picking up posts from a few dozen science blogs, who have committed to a post a day of just science content. I'll be participating, and while daily science content is nothing unusual here, it may be a great opportunity to find other interesting blogs that you haven't noticed before. Lots of interesting writing about science, all collected in one place -- sounds like a winner!
