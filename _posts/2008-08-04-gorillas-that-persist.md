<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/science/05apes.html">Good news for gorilla conservation</a>: 

<blockquote>A grueling survey of vast tracts of forest and swamp in the northern Congo Republic has revealed the presence of more than 125,000 western lowland gorillas, a rare example of abundance in a world of rapidly vanishing primate populations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The survey was conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society and local researchers in largely unstudied terrain, including a swampy region nicknamed the green abyss by the first biologists to cross it. Dr. Steven E. Sanderson, the president of the society, marveled at the scope of what the survey revealed. The message from our community is so often one of despair, he said. While we dont want to relax our concern, its just great to discover that these animals are doing well.</blockquote>
