<i>Smithsonian</i> magazine has a feature highlighting the fleshed-out hominin reconstructions of John Gurche (<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html">"A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces"</a>). 

<blockquote>While <i>Homo erectus</i>, which lived at about the same time, was sampling meat, <i>P. boisei</i> remained a devout vegetarian, which is why, Gurche says, the expression I was going for was a sort of bovine contentment.</blockquote>

The reconstructions are part of the new human evolution hall at the National Museum of Natural History.
