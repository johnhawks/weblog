Brian Switek comments on this week's "Megalodon" program on <em>Discovery</em>, which lured viewers with the idea that a prehistoric gigantic shark might still be circling around out there somewhere: <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/09/it-came-from-basic-cable/">"It Came from Basic Cable"</a>.

<blockquote>But in all this outrage, we shouldnt forget that hoaxes, fraud, deception, and salacious depiction have existed for as long as there have been wildlife films. I dont expect that to change anytime soon, especially since the most popular shows are the ones that are unapologetic fakes. Audiences bear some responsibility for making these monsters, too.</blockquote>

The best line is at the end: "Everybody is chumming for viewers".
