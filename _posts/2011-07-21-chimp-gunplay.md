MSNBC reports on the really important issues, such as, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43813914/ns/technology_and_science-science/">"Will chimpanzees rise against us?"</a>

<blockquote>Any chimp gunplay would most likely be restricted to mimicry. [Primatologist John] Mitani believes actor chimps would likely learn to operate machine guns to please their trainers and receive rewards, but he doesn't think the apes are capable of using them to purposely do harm. "When shooting the gun, I'd be hard-pressed to think that the chimp can really understand (the consequences of) what he's doing."</blockquote>

Hmmm...we're talking about creatures that will <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1548">tear off a man's testicles</a>, here. I have a feeling that chimps manning a submachine gun would cackle with chimpish glee.
