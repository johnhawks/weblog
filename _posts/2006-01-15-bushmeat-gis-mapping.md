<i>Science</i> has a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol311/issue5758/netwatch.dtl">NetWatch feature</a> that pointed me to <a href="http://www.bushmeat.org/IMAP/BushmeatGIS.htm">the Bushmeat Mapserver</a> from the Bushmeat Crisis Task Force. 
</p>

<p>
The server allows you to dynamically overlay extant species ranges with other landscape features such as protected areas, human population density, roads and logging concessions. The database has geographic information for 33 species, including all the African apes and 12 monkeys. 
</p>

<p>
Seems like a great tool for making lecture slides about primate conservation, as well as a way to track the problem.
