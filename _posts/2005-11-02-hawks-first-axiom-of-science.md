OK, I never thought I would start a list like this, but I have been irritated enough, already! So here it is:

<h3>Axiom I</h3>
<h4>The scatterplot conjecture</h4>

<i>An empirical paper with fewer than 100 observations that does not include a scatterplot is to be seriously doubted.</i>

<p>
Some selected papers may overcome this presumption of doubt, but scatterplot-avoidance is almost always a strategy to (a) cover up significant outliers, or (b) keep data secret so that the statistics cannot be replicated. Since these motives are enemies of science, the lack of a scatterplot (or even better, the data themselves) must inspire serious doubt.
