Joe Pickrell encountered sticker shock when faced with the prospect of a medical sequencing test: <a href="http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/09/the-week-that-i-worried-i-had-a-rare-genetic-disease.php">"The week that I worried I had a rare genetic disease"</a>. 

<blockquote>Whats really striking to me is that the price of whole genome sequencing is already competitive with commercial Sanger sequencing tests of individual genes. </blockquote>

Amazing how much patent-laden (and labor-intensive) sequencing work can charge to insurance.
