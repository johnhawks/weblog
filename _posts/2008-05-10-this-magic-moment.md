<p>
Today, the projected population of the Earth (available <a href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html">here</a>) passed 6,666,666,666. 
</p>

<p>
Around 9 years ago, I tried to put into the first sentence of a paper that the world's population was 6 billion. A reviewer wouldn't let me get away with rounding up, noting that "It's not 6 billion yet!" 
</p>

<p>
Of course, by the time the paper was published, the sentence was true.
