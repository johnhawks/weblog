Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/vivian_porter_sketchbook_2009.jpg" height="309" width="400" alt="Vivian Porter sketch" />
</div>

Gretchen told me I needed to draw some women to go with all those men. So I drew a picture of Vivian Porter, a performer in Ziegfeld's "Follies" and "George White's Scandals." HB and 4B pencil on Caslon paper.
