A reader forwarded the news about <a href="http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/sep/04/now-it-can-be-told-panda-cub-male/?metro&zIndex=160323">a new baby panda at the San Diego Zoo</a>. Now, I know everybody expects to get their hot panda news here, but the video was basically unlinkable. So I started looking through the recent headlines about pandas. 

The panda probers have been busy:

<blockquote>The panda cub born Aug. 5 at the San Diego Zoo is a boy, the institution's officials said yesterday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After four weeks of waiting for the right moment, zookeepers were able to examine the newest panda, which now weighs 2.8 pounds. </blockquote>



Well, as we all know, no panda insemination can go unreported. Here's <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/09/your-morning-adorable-thailands-celebrity-panda-cub-celebrates-a-milestone.html">a report from the <i>LA Times</i></a>: 

<blockquote>We'll be the first to admit it: We didn't find Lin Ping, the giant panda cub born in late May at Thailand's Chiang Mai Zoo, terribly cute at first.... But the cub recently hit a milestone -- 100 days of age -- and now, we're happy to say, she is so adorable it's almost painful to look at her.</blockquote>

Another <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/05/content_12000537.htm">giant baby panda</a> (er...baby giant panda) was born in China: 

<blockquote> "The recent baby boom indicates we have made some progress in pandas' semen collection and freezing as well as prenatal care," said Jin [Xuelin].</blockquote>


Oh, sure, they're cute and cuddly when they're tiny. But then they grow up to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-suburban-drug-houses-tuesep07,0,5794018.story">become drug lords</a>: 

<blockquote>What neighbors didn't know, but what federal authorities now allege, is that this family -- husband, wife and young son -- was hired in Mexico, given a car and directions to Joliet and paid to live there as part of an elaborate ploy to disguise the two-story home's true purpose. It was to serve as a stash house for a drug ring that allegedly raked in about $10 million a year selling cocaine, most recently under the leadership of a man named "Panda."</blockquote>

Even so, their role in international relations may be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=afHT4pp9E1QQ">getting out of control:</a>

<blockquote><b>China Caucus Welcomes Panda Slayers and Boosters in Congress </b></blockquote>

Nothing can beat the British penchant for constant government surveillance, now <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23740872-details/Artful+makeover+for+WWF+panda/article.do">enhanced with panda power<a/>: 

<blockquote>London-based artist Jason Bruges created an army of 100 collection-pot pandas, with thermal cameras causing the models to rotate to face passers-by.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"They look cute at first, but the movement and having them following you is quite unnerving. It forces you to think about climate change," he said.</blockquote>

OK, well maybe one thing can beat that -- Matchbox 20 frontman <a href="http://www.thecelebritytruth.com/rob-thomas-ponders-life-pandas-disco-twitter/009224">Rob Thomas tweeting about the coming panda apocalypse</a>: 

<blockquote>what if panda bears take over and say that from now on, the international currency is hugs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>maybe something horrible happens to the earth, we all die, and find out that life on earth isnt the big deal, but the new place is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>i like the panda theory, myself.</blockquote>

And you thought I was messed up.
