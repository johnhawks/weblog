Macartan Humphreys, of Columbia University, has written a short essay on <a href="http://www.macartan.nyc/comments/poor-allies/">"Gender discrimination in political science and the problem of poor allies"</a>. It begins with a personal story, then moves into broader issues in his field of political science.


<blockquote>Looking back I think I found it easy to explain things away because at bottom I thought of myself as someone who does not discriminate and so there must be reasonable explanations for things that others might see as discrimination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With quite a bit of distance though I can see problems with my self explanations. </blockquote>

These are important issues to be conscious of.
