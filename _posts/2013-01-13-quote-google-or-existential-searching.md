Nicholas Carr, beginning a post discussing the increasing role of Google not only in finding what we're looking for, but in anticipating the searches we haven't yet started (<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2459"</a>The searchers</a>):

<blockquote>When we talk about searching these days, were almost always talking about using Google to find something online. Thats quite a turn for a word that has always carried existential connotations, that has always been bound up in our sense of what it means to be conscious and alive. We dont just search for car keys or missing socks. We search for truth and meaning, for love, for transcendence, for peace, for ourselves. To be human is to be a searcher.</blockquote>
