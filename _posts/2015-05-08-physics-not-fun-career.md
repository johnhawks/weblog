Chanda Prescod-Weinstein has written an evocative essay about her experience becoming a physicist, and the daily frustrations and challenges of being different in background from those ordinarily welcomed into the field:
<a href="https://medium.com/@chanda/let-astro-physics-be-the-dream-it-used-to-be-d4fb44268a8d">"Let Physics Be the Dream It Used To Be"</a>

<blockquote>I’m not going to catalog every shitty thing that happened to me in grad school or as a postdoc even though I haven’t actually mentioned the worst stuff, but the point is that <strong>I didn’t and still don’t fit into the dominant astro/physics culture, and this has really sucked a lot of the fun out of physics for me.</strong> White astro/physicists need to understand and take to heart that this is in fact a real issue that doesn’t magically go away with admissions and diversity initiatives that fail to address underlying cultural, <em>structural</em> issues.</blockquote>

She reminds us that science as a career choice has many unappealing qualities, particularly for those who lie outside a particular social background.
