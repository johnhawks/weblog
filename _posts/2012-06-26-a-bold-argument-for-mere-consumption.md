I got passed along this article in the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, and it just keeps striking me as BS: <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Just-Because-Were-Not/132183/">"Just Because We're Not Publishing Doesn't Mean We're Not Working"</a>. 

<blockquote>We have no concise term to describe what we spend much of our time doing. Our colleges are focused on scholarly products that can be peer-reviewed and published, but the reality is that many of us spend much of our time on being scholarly, not on producing scholarship. We are, and should be, consuming the scholarship of others. Consuming scholarship includes preparatory time for teaching but is much broader. We need a name for this ubiquitous activity. I offer "consumatory scholarship."</blockquote>

I suppose "consumatory scholarship" sounds better than "consumptive scholarship", mainly because it doesn't draw attention to the reality that it's the opposite of "productive scholarship"...
