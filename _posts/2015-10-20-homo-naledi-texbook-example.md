An interesting take from Steven Newton of NCSE on the <em>Homo naledi</em> context paper by Paul Dirks and our team: <a href="http://ncse.com/blog/2015/10/cave-homo-naledi-textbook-example-how-to-do-science-0016693">"The Cave of Homo naledi, or A Textbook Example of How to Do Science"</a>.

<blockquote>The work on <em>H. naledi</em> is amazing science, and this section on geology and taphonomy by Dirks et al. is an excellent example of how scientists think. There are a whole bunch of possible alternate explanations, and they get whittled down one-by-one, until the only thing left is the improbable, counter-intuitive conclusion that <em>H. naledi</em> individuals were deliberately dropped into this cave. Dirks et al. have addressed virtually every other explanation and demonstrated why they don't fit with the evidence.</blockquote>

It's a useful guide to how the mystery of the Dinaledi Chamber might be used to help teach the scientific method.
