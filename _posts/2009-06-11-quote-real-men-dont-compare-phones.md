This is random, but <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348410,00.asp">John Dvorak writing about the portable phone craze</a> had me laughing: 

<blockquote>In the 1950s (when men were men), the same group wouldn't be around a dinner table sipping Chardonnay and showing off their effete phones. They'd be outside at a drive-in eating beef and showing off the motors in their cars. They be comparing carburetors rather than counting iPhone apps.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Times have indeed changed. Today nobody even knows what a carburetor is, let alone how a motor works. Instead they're pinching photos on their iPhones and thinking to themselves, "Wow, neat-o!" It's out and out pathetic when you stop to think about it.</blockquote>
