From <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/08/imperfect-savage-life.html">Ann Althouse</a>:

<blockquote>Do you ever romanticize the caveman and think, yes, it might be all right to be a Neanderthal, and you then think of one modern product that you want so much that you can't even seriously contemplate the savage life anymore? For me it's Chapstick.</blockquote>
