<p>
There was an international meeting in Indonesia about the Flores hominids last week, including scientific presentations and a visit to the cave. I have a regular correspondent who very kindly gave me a short report on some of the proceedings, which included CT scans of the mastoid process (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/hershkovitz_laron_syndrome_2007.html">See here</a> for why that may be relevant).

Reporter Elizabeth Culotta was at the meeting, so there will likely be an article about it in <i>Science</i> somewhere in the next few issues.
