News on an <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081222113522.htm">interesting dissertation about the last glaciation</a>: 

<blockquote>According to the previously accepted hypothesis, Sweden was covered with ice 75,000-20,000 years ago. Martina Httestrands hypothesis, on the other hand, is that Sweden may have largely been ice-free between 59,000 and 40,000 years ago. If this is true, the last ice sheet of the Ice Age formed much more rapidly than was previously believed in order to have reached all the way down to northern Germany during the maximum phase about 22,000 years ago.</blockquote>
