Last week, <i>Nature's</i> jobs website did <a href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2009/090212/full/nj7231-922a.html">a feature on careers in biological anthropology</a>. It's an overview from anatomy and forensics to evolution and genetics, featuring Jean-Jacques Hublin, David Strait, Eugenie Scott, and Helen Fisher, among others. 

<blockquote>Today, bioanthropology is a hybrid of life and social science that probes human anatomy through the lenses of culture, behaviour and evolution. It addresses "what it means to be human", says Hilton Silva, a bioanthropologist at the Federal University of Par, Brazil. Career opportunities are as multifaceted as the discipline itself.</blockquote>

Could be a good article to pass out to students.
