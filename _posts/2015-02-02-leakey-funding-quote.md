Louis Leakey, in a letter to Wilfrid Le Gros Clark (cited in Morrell, V., _Ancestral Passions_, p. 209), just after his and Mary's discoveries of _Zinjanthropus_, _Homo habilis_, and Olduvai _Homo erectus_ fossils in 1959 and 1960:

<blockquote>You may be wondering, as others have done, why we are finding so much hominid material now.... The answer is simple. We have been working <em>continuously now since February with adequate funds</em> and a huge labour staff, and have already put in some 72,000 man hours this year. Had we been able to do this sort of thing before, we would have had the results before.</blockquote>
