Jo Marchant elegizes an 1858 lecture by John Ruskin, on the topic of iron (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/apr/28/wellcome-science-writing-prize">"Not just any old iron"</a>). I had to relay this quote: 

<blockquote>"Is it not strange to find this stern and strong metal mingled so delicately in our human life that we cannot even blush without its help?"</blockquote>
