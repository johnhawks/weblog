Guadalupe Sanchez and colleagues reported earlier this month that Clovis artifacts have been found in association with parts of two gomphothere skeletons in Mexico: <a href="http://dx.doi/org/10.1073/pnas.1404546111">"Human (Clovis)–gomphothere (<em>Cuvieronius</em> sp.) association ∼13,390 calibrated yBP in Sonora, Mexico"</a>. 

Gomphotheres are an extinct family of proboscideans, previously thought to have disappeared long before the first occurrence of humans in the Americas. In fact the last occurrence of <em>Cuvieronius</em> before this is more than 40,000 years ago. It's a good example of the last occurrence fallacy -- the assumption that if attested dates of two things don't overlap, they cannot have co-occurred. In reality, of course, the last known occurrence must be earlier than the true last occurrence of a species. How much earlier is a matter of sampling density, and paleontological sampling is usually pretty sparse -- especially for rare species.
