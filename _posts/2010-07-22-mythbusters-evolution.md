A rerun <i>MythBusters</i> tonight was a rejiggering of myths they'd already covered, titled "MythBusters Evolution". Here's how they started: 

<blockquote>JAMIE: So, MythBusters Evolution...does that mean we're going to be testing myths <i>about</i> evolution?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ADAM: No, Darwin doesn't need any help. </blockquote>

Good for them! Of course, the MythBusters are well-known for taking on myths from the Darwin Awards...
