<em>Gizmodo:</em> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/china-has-already-gene-edited-86-people-with-crispr-1822297524">"China Has Already Gene-Edited 86 People With CRISPR"</a>.


<blockquote>In China’s 2015 CRISPR trial, the WSJ reports, 36 patients with cancers of the kidney, lung, liver and throat had cells removed from their bodies, altered with CRISPR, and then infused back into their bodies to fight the cancer. Other Chinese trials have sought to use CRISPR to treat HIV, esophaegeal cancer, and leukemia. A trial slated for this year in China will enroll 16 patients. Meanwhile, the first human CRISPR trial in the U.S., at University of Pennsylvania, will enroll just 18 people, and is designed primarily to test whether CRISPR is safe.</blockquote>

In an unrelated related story, Donald Trump's State of the Union Address is notable for his mention of "Right to Try" legislation. From Ike Swetlitz at <em>STAT</em>: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/state-of-the-union-trump-right-to-try/">"In State of the Union, Trump endorses ‘right to try’ for terminally ill patients"</a>

<blockquote>“We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives,” Trump said in his speech. “People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure — I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the ‘right to try.’”</blockquote>

I expect that gene editing experiments are not far off in the U.S.
