The BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7570928.stm">a story about Y chromosome matches</a> between German Bronze Age skeletons and a couple of guys living in the same area now:

<blockquote>"I didn't expect it at all, to end up being the direct descendant of the cavemen. It's amazing, especially as on that particular day I had such a dry mouth, I thought the DNA sample wouldn't work," he said.</blockquote>

Looks like the Y chromosome equivalent of <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9807EEDB133BF937A15750C0A961958260">the Cheddar Man mtDNA match</a> from 10 years ago. The import of both stories is roughly the same -- considerable local genetic survival from prehistoric times.
