More evidence of <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100104-amazon-lost-civilization-circles.html">dense Precolumbian habitation of the Amazon basin</a>: 

<blockquote>Hundreds of circles, squares, and other geometric shapes once hidden by forest hint at a previously unknown ancient society that flourished in the Amazon, a new study says.

Satellite images of the upper Amazon Basin taken since 1999 have revealed more than 200 geometric earthworks spanning a distance greater than 155 miles (250 kilometers).</blockquote>

On the one hand it's cool that they are able to find these with satellite imagery. On the other hand, it's sad that in the <i>Amazon</i> they can find these with techniques that were developed to find sites in <i>deserts</i>.
