Larry Moran writes, <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/10/are-you-descedant-of-charlemagne.html">"Are you a descendant of Charlemagne?"</a>

<blockquote>Thousands of amateur genealogists have contributed to a huge database of family relationships, including genetic analyses. What does this teach us about human populations and evolution?</blockquote>

It touches on some issues covered in more detail in Steve Olson's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618352104?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0618352104"><i>Mapping Human History: Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins</i></a>, which remains surprisingly relevant today despite the explosion in genetic data. That's because Olson did a good job on the population genetics side. 

Oh, and yes I am a descendant of Charlemagne. Woo-hoo!
