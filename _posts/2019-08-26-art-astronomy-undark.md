I'd like to point to a recent article from <em>Undark</em> by writer Mara Johnson-Groh, looking at the way that artistic visualization methods have been important to astronomy in recent years: <a href="https://undark.org/article/astronomy-art/">"Sketching the Stars: How Art Can Advance Astronomy"</a>

The article profiles several real-world examples where scientists have applied art techniques to build a better means of visualizing and understanding large astronomical datasets. This one was trippy:

<blockquote>With the aid of a specialized loom, they have also created woven installations nearly the size of a van that visualize the interconnectivity of the cosmic web. “We believe that art, as much as science, seeks to say something true about the nature of existence,” they wrote in a 2017 paper on their collaboration, “and that end is best served by artistic representation that grapples with real data and not only with allegorical concepts.”</blockquote>

The bottom line of the article is encompassed in the last paragraph:

<blockquote>“Applying the techniques from art definitely influences the way astronomers see and interact with their data,” English said. “I don’t think [techniques from art] in astronomy visualization can be relegated to a sidebar any longer. It really does enhance discovery science.”</blockquote>

Human genetics is always a step or two behind astronomy in terms of data processing and visualization. I see a lot of promise over the next few years in developing new ways of visualizing and understanding genetic datasets from humans and other creatures.
