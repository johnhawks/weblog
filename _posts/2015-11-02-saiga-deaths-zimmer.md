Carl Zimmer reports on some of the work being done to understand the extreme die-offs of saiga antelopes in Central Asia: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/science/more-than-half-entire-species-of-saigas-gone-in-mysterious-die-off.html?_r=0">"More Than Half of Entire Species of Saigas Gone in Mysterious Die-Off"</a>. 

<blockquote>Once individual saigas became ill, they typically died within hours. Entire herds were quickly wiped out. “This is really not biologically normal,” Dr. Kock said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Necropsies revealed internal bleeding, and blood testing showed that the saigas suffered massive infections of bacteria called <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> and <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These species are normally harmless constituents of the microbiomes of many animals. From time to time, however, they can explode into deadly infections.</blockquote>

I find it disquieting that a "normally harmless constituent" of the microbiome might go on an unpredictable killing spree under slightly unusual temperature or rainfall conditions. The death toll from this year's event is 150,000 saigas.
