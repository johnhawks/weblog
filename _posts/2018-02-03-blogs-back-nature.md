<em>Nature</em> this week has a nice feature article on blogging in science, by Eryn Brown and Chris Woolston: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01414-6">"Why science blogging still matters"</a>.

This marks my fifteenth year of blogging, and so I obviously think it's worthwhile. I think the process of blogging is a lot like science itself -- there are many ways to accomplish something, there are many more very smart people than there are obvious opportunities, and to be a real success, you have to find ways to do things that other people wouldn't think of.

Of course, sometimes that just means persevering!

<blockquote>The survey uncovered some telling attitudes towards blogs and other forms of science outreach. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that a lack of time was a ‘great obstacle’ to any sort of science communication.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But almost 70% agreed that communicating science can help to advance a researcher’s career, and nearly 90% said that it could help to recruit more bright minds to science.</blockquote>

I don't think that blogs are especially good for reaching new audiences who do not already care about science. Blogs can be very good for helping already-interested people keep in the loop about new developments in a specialized area.

What I've noticed over the last few years is that a lot of professionals are now writing brief comments on new scientific work on Facebook, and linking to news articles, etc. And that has really yielded a "dumbing down" of commentary. Mainstream reporting on human evolution has actually gotten a lot worse in the last few years.

I've been happy to see a number of researchers in the last year or so publishing "blog posts" about their research findings on <em>The Conversation</em>. That's a nice outlet enabling researchers to share their ideas directly, and gives a much better context for research findings than most media articles. What I'm a bit dismayed by is that these posts do not get shared very often on Facebook and other social media.
