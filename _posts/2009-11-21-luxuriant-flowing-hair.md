A <a href="http://improbable.com/projects/hair/">club I won't be joining,</a> from <i>Improbable Research</i>:

<blockquote><b>Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The first member, chosen by acclamation, was psychologist Steven Pinker, whose hair has long been the object of admiration, and envy, and intense study. From that lone, Pinkerian seed, there has grown a spreading chestnut, black, blond, and red-haired membership tree, which you can see below and on the other LFHCfS web pages.</blockquote>

Maybe my cool red-headed Neandertal can get on board with that.
