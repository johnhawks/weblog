Today's sketchbook:

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/stands_first_curtis_sketchbook.jpg" width="300" height="359" alt="Sketch of Stands First, Ogalala, from a print by Edward Curtis" />
</div>

This is one of Edward Curtis' prints of American Indians, dating from 1908 -- "Stands First, Ogalala". The old photos are good for value studies. 

4B pencil on Strathmore drawing paper.
