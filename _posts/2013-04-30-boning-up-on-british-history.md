From <em>The Guardian</em>: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/30/richard-iii-archaeologists-leicester-knight">"Richard III archaeologists to return to Leicester site in search of lost knight"</a>.

<blockquote>This time the team is applying to the Home Office for an exhumation licence for a lead-lined stone sarcophagus, which they believe holds the undisturbed remains of Sir William Moton, believed to have been buried at Grey Friars in 1362.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The original dig was funded by the Richard III Society, but the next phase will be paid for by the university and city council, which is predicting a tourism bonanza from the discovery.</blockquote>

My rule of thumb: When British people are doing something ghoulish because they predict a "tourism bonanza", look around for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">a blue police box</a>.
