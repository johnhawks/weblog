Carl Zimmer profiles anatomist Joy Reidenberg, who has scored a coup for public communication of science on the BBC show, Inside Nature's Giants: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/science/joy-reidenberg-anatomist-builds-a-following-on-inside-natures-giants.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">"From Inside Lions and Leviathans, Anatomist Builds a Following"</a>. Joy is well-known in paleoanthropology circles:

<blockquote>For her Ph.D., she came to Mount Sinai Medical School to work with Jeffrey T. Laitman, an expert on the anatomy of the head and neck.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the 1970s, Dr. Laitman has been looking for anatomical clues to the evolution of human speech. Dr. Reidenberg expanded the scope of his work to look at the vocal anatomy of mammals, from moose to rabbits. In 1983, she began teaching at Mount Sinai, and she has focused much of her research on the most remarkable of all mammal voices: those of whales and dolphins."</blockquote>

Can't wait until the show gets going here.
