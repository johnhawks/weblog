In the wake of recent zombie-related films, there is <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html">this article</a> from NEWS.com.au, by Nick Buchan: 
</p>

<blockquote>US scientists have succeeded in reviving the dogs after three hours of clinical death, paving the way for trials on humans within years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pittsburgh's Safar Centre for Resuscitation Research has developed a technique in which subject's veins are drained of blood and filled with an ice-cold salt solution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The animals are considered scientifically dead, as they stop breathing and have no heartbeat or brain activity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But three hours later, their blood is replaced and the zombie dogs are brought back to life with an electric shock.</blockquote>

<p>
The next step is to test the method on humans, which the report says should occur within a year. The motive is to keep people alive after severe trauma or blood loss -- especially after battlefield injuries. When surgical repairs can be accomplished, the body would be restarted.

Is it creepy? I suppose if it leads to bloodlust (or brainlust), then yes.
