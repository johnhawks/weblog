Re: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/denisova/skoglund-jakobsson-2011-south-china.html">"How widespread is Denisovan ancestry today?"</a>

<blockquote>Your website is so interesting I wish I were an anthropologist!  The
heat map showing interpolated spatial distribution of the frequency of
Denisova alleles struck me - for a different reason than the subject
of the article.  Does this map add weight to the argument for a
possible southern route for at least some of the peopling of the
Americas?  Or is it simply assumed that somehow all traces of these
gene signatures would simply disappear during the migration from a
northern route?  I am trying to understand how this makes sense if the
peopling of the Americas was exclusively a Northern route.

Thanks for wonderful website.</blockquote>

Not clear. The map is showing such a very small fraction of the overall genetic variation, that the similarity between the south China and central America region may be just noise. If I were to set about answering the question about New World habitation, I would start with a very different approach. Worth some consideration.
