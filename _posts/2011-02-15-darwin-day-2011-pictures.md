Darwin Day was a huge success here in Madison. We had a crowd of several hundred people, including families doing our "Tree of Life" hands-on activities, and nearly 200 interested people who attended the lectures. 

To give some idea of the size of the venue and crowd, here's the front half of the lecture forum with me as a tiny figure at the front:

Here's Jill Pruetz, starting the keynote lecture on Friday evening, describing her groundbreaking work with the chimpanzees of Fongoli, Senegal:

Saturday's featured lecturer was Karen Rosenberg, on the evolution of the human birth process:

I had the privilege of introducing Karen's lecture. As you can see, I was pretty thrilled about the whole day:

What a wonderful event!
