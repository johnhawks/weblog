The museum and research center at Sangiran, Indonesia is capped by a large copper conical roof. The surrounding countryside is the source of Early and Middle Pleistocene fossils of many vertebrates, including <em>Homo</em>. It is intensively farmed with many small plots, rice, teak plantations and other crops.
