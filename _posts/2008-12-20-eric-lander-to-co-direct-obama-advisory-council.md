Genome scientist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2008/12/20/us/AP-Obama.html?_r=1">Eric Lander has been appointed co-chair</a> of Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology:

<blockquote>[Physicist John] Holdren also will direct the president's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Joining him as co-chairs will be Nobel Prize-winning scientist Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Eric Lander, a specialist in human genome research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lander, who teaches at both MIT and Harvard, founded the Whitehead Institute-MIT Center for Genome Research in 1990, which became part of the Broad Institute in 2003. A leading researcher in the Human Genome Project, he and his colleagues are using the findings to explore the molecular mechanisms behind human disease.</blockquote>

Relevant in view of <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/testing/obama-health-genetics-policy-2008.html">upcoming policy on genetic information standards</a> and government involvement in personal genomics.
