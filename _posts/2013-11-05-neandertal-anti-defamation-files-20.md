I was just telling an audience of 500 the other day that Neandertals were really not very much like professional athletes. Now this, from <em>BusinessWeek</em>: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-11-05/nfl-players-with-elite-college-degrees-become-bullying-targets#p2">"NFL Players With Elite College Degrees Become Bullying Targets"</a>

<blockquote>Theres enough stress in the everyday life of making a team and trying to stay on the team, Kacyvenski said. The whole idea of hazing is outdated, its gone. Its a Neanderthal way to have this rite of passage. The rite of passage is how you play on Sunday.</blockquote>

I imagine there was no Neandertal hazing. And if there had been Neandertal hazing, they would have had much better imaginations than these guys.
