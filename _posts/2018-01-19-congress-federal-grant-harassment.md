Two years ago this month, I asked, <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/ethics/harassment/astronomy-harassment-look-money-2016.html">"Why do universities cover up high-profile harassment? Look for the money"</a>.

Now the U.S. Congress seems to be asking the same question: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/lamar-smith-investigates-sexual-harassment?utm_term=.mvKw85ePM#.mq4AWKrJ9">"Congress Is Demanding Answers About Why Federal Grants Are Given To Harassers In Science"</a>.

<blockquote>The letter asks NIH, NSF, USDA, DOE, and NASA to report: how many cases of sexual harassment or assault have actually been investigated at their agencies; what they do when they receive complaints about a grantee; and whether they require grantees to inform them of allegations of sexual harassment or gender discrimination.</blockquote>

This appears to be a bipartisan request from the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. In the field of anthropology, we know enough from the Survey of Academic Fieldwork Experiences study to know that millions of federal dollars have been directed toward field research programs where sexual harassment and assault, bullying, and hazing have been frighteningly routine.

As <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/sexual-harassment/russell-harassment-sciam-2017.html">I wrote last year</a>:

<blockquote>We know from the 2014 SAFE study that harassment and assault have been very common in recent and existing field programs in archaeology and anthropology. Millions of dollars of funding have gone to researchers who maintain field projects that are widely rumored to be sites where abuses have happened for years. Researchers have used this support to intimidate and silence the targets of their abuse, and have evaded scrutiny from institutions because of the federal dollars they bring in (“Why do universities cover up high-profile harassment? Look for the money”). Meanwhile, the institutions who received 50% or more overhead on these NSF grants did not maintain minimal levels of professional standards by the site directors.</blockquote>

More details about these abuses need to be brought to light.
