It's that time of year again -- the time when those boring ``Year in Review'' magazines are on newsstands, and when pundits make fools of themselves predicting what will happen in the next year. 
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm not too proud to join the fools, as I've shown the last two years. In 2006, I got five predictions right out of ten. Not bad for my first outing, but you'll see that last year's predictions fared even better: 
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>10. <i>Sahelanthropus</i> postcrania will be published.</b> I'm frankly shocked that this didn't happen. I don't doubt the rumors, but I'm starting to wonder whether this story is more interesting than it looks....</li>

<li><b>9. Two words: Holocene evolution.</b> OK, this was a little unfair, considering that my work was an important part of making this prediction come true. Still, <i>Discover</i> made ``recent human evolution'' one of its top 100 science stories of the year, even before our December paper came out -- mainly on the strength of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030090">the paper by Scott Williamson and colleagues</a> from earlier this year. And "Human genetic variation" was <i>Science's</i> "Breakthrough of the Year" -- most of that variation representing recent evolution. </li>

<li><b>8. Despite (or because of) the success of the Neandertal genome project, there will be no genetics of any kind published on early modern skeletal material.</b> Puzzling, isn't it? But then, considering the trouble with Neandertal contamination reported in August, maybe we're better off leaving the early Upper Paleolithic alone for a while. </li>

<li><b>7. The mitochondrial history of human dispersals will become more and more detailed, but no paper will test against other loci.</b> D'oh! Reading this one a year later, it's pretty obvious that I should have included Y chromosome in this one, since <i>those two</i> get compared all the time! Proofread, Hawks!</li>

<li><b>6. Another (yes, another) paper about the chimpanzee-human divergence will peg it between 5 and 7 million years ago.</b> Will they never tire of these? Hobolth et al. (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030007">2007, PLoS Genet 3:e7</a>) pegged the divergence at 4.1 million years. That's too recent to fit my prediction. Instead, I have to turn to Ebersberger et al. (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msm156">2007, Mol Biol Evol 24:2276</a>), who placed the divergence at 5.7 million years ago. Both estimates are too recent for <i>Sahelanthropus</i>, which the geneticists have started to figure out.... </li>

<li><b>5. Three papers with new Ethiopian fossils.</b> The last few years, one annual Ethiopian find seemed to be predictable enough. So I figured, why not three? We got a not-nearly-noted-enough paper this summer by Gen Suwa and colleagues descringing the Konso <i>Homo erectus</i> remains. Then, Suwa brought us <i>Chororapithecus</i> -- hey, I didn't say "hominid!" That's two. But despite the long-ago announcement of the Woranso-Mille skeleton, its appearance in a meetings abstract and a mid-summer press release about further Mille fossils, all we got from the peer review system is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1537/ase.070426">a lousy faunal list</a>. Well, the faunal list <i>does</i> include the hominids. Should it count as a "paper with new Ethiopian fossils?" I'll say yes -- hey, unlike Aramis, at least the Mille fossils <i>are</i> new!	</li>

<li><b>4. Another early Upper Paleolithic specimen will emerge from a museum collection.</b> The only bizarre thing about this one was the location: South Africa. Hoffmeyr may not be that convincing as a European early Upper Paleolithic skull, but it was sure sold that way. Weird. </li>

<li><b>3. A big year for Miocene apes, which will look increasingly important in the story of human brain evolution.</b> No brains, but it sure was a big year for Miocene apes, with two significant East African discoveries claiming to push back the timeline of African ape divergence. </li>

<li><b>2. Maturation rate in early <i>Homo</i> becomes a dead issue, because of the variation in dental and skeletal maturation in living people.</b> Wishful thinking. Still, did Tanya Smith (2007) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0707051104">breathe new life</a> into perikymata? Let's just say that unresolved questions remain.</li>

<li><b>1. The year will end without a single new hominid species having been named.</b> This one was like dodging a bullet, since new species riffle out of paleoanthropologists' minds all the time. From 2001 to 2006, there were six (six!). In 2007, none.  </li>

<li><b>BONUS: A dramatic development in the problem of pre-2.0-million-year-old Homo.</b> Rats. </li>

</ul>

<p>
OK, that's seven out of ten. It's beyond belief that I did better in the top five than the bottom five -- I picked those because they were far out there. I mean, really -- a new Upper Paleolithic specimen from a museum collection? After Muierii, that's like calling lightning to strike twice. But there it is, and in January, no less. 
</p>

<p>
I'm clearly going to have to pick stranger predictions this year. And I'll have to be careful about that "dramatic development" line -- I mean, it's appropriately Delphic, but what is it supposed to mean, really? I wonder whether "operatic development" might be better.
</p>

<p>
And do I dare call down my <i>non</i>-lightning strike for a third year? It's ruining my percentage! It's starting to reek of desperation -- I mean, it starts to look like the stopped watch effect even if it happens. 
</p>

<p>
Oh, well. I mean, those are just the risks of predictions, right? Suppose in the preseason I had picked Kansas to win the Orange Bowl!
</p>

<ul>

<li>10. A dramatic development in the <i>Sahelanthropus</i> story.</li>

<li>9. Both major-party candidates for the 2008 U.S. Presidential election will accept evolution. </li>

<li>8. This year's featured piece of anatomy: the femur. </li>

<li>7. No new hobbits, at least, not from Flores. </li>

<li>6. An incisive example of introgression in East Asia. </li>

<li>5. A viral insertion in the human genome will tell us about a disease of the australopithecines. </li>

<li>4. Another language gene joins <i>FoxP2</i>. No word on whether Neandertals have the human version. </li>

<li>3. <i>Homo habilis</i>: an endangered species? </li>

<li>2. This year, something new from three A's: <i>A. afarensis</i>. <i>A. africanus</i>. Atapuerca.</li>

<li>1. Oh, and one more A. <i>Ardipithecus</i>. </li>

<li>BONUS: A big, big year for Neandertals. I mean, <i>besides</i> the election. </li>

</ul>

<p>
There you have it. I'm not sure which of these is the riskiest, but I'm sure they're more out on a limb than last year!
