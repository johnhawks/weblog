Alice Bell on public engagement for social scientists and humanists: <a href="http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2011/05/being-professional-about-impact/">"Being professional about 'impact'."</a>

<blockquote>Me, Im a public sector professional, and as such, I take pride in the ways in which I may cultivate an independent voice, but do so within a network of constraints provided by public service. Listening to outside voices is not a threat to my professionalism; its an expression of it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are paid to do our research. Teaching a small set of kids privileged enough to go to university, or publishing in esoteric journals only a couple of people will read does not cut it. Moreover, it doesnt challenge our ideas enough to make the sort of high quality work we should be producing. Earn public trust by showing off your worth. You may well learn something in the process too.</blockquote>
