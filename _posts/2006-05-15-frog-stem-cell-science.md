Science Blog <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/frogs-can-play-key-role-in-stem-cell-research-10598.html">has this press release</a> from the University of Edinburgh: 
</p>

<blockquote>It sounds like one of those curiosities which pops up in wildlife documentaries, but the African clawed frog could prove a powerful ally for scientists working in the key area of stem cell research. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have discovered that the distinctive species - which has become popular in recent years as a domestic pet - shares with humans the same genetic mechanism that enables embryonic stem cells to divide without limit. This process, which gives embryonic stem cells the capacity to become any of the 200 cell types in the body, is fundamental to all research in the discipline.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The findings are also interesting because they highlight that the remarkable capacity of embryonic stem cells to divide without limit is at least 300 million years old. "It was very exciting, and humbling, to find that the proteins from such an ancient animal such as the frog can rescue the behaviour of 'modern' mouse embryonic stem cells. It told us so much about where this behaviour comes from, and how long ago," said Dr Morrison.</blockquote>

I don't really have any comment, except that <i>this is exactly the plot of <u>Jurassic Park</u>!</i>
