Here's a painful analogy deployed by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2843720">Arthur Keith (1924:253)</a> for Neandertal dental anatomy:

<blockquote>The nature of the taurodontal change in tooth formation may be explained by the use of a homely illustration. It is the fashion in Europe to separate the legs of trousers---which correspond to the roots of the teeth up to the fork of the thighs. But there have been fashions where the seat of trousers, corresponding to the floor of the pulp cavity, has been carried down to the level of the knees, or even to the ankles. In teeth of the taurodont form the seat is carried to correspondingly low levels, or, as in this example from Ghar Dalam (Fig. 1, E), carried to the level of the ground and thus turned into a skirt.</blockquote>
