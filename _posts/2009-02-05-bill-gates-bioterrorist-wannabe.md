Well, when <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29022220/">you've got a captive audience</a>....

<blockquote>LONG BEACH, Calif. - "Bill Gates just released mosquitos into the audience at TED and said, 'Not only poor people should experience this.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>That was the post by Facebook's Senior Platform Manager Dave Morin on social networking site Twitter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The mosquito incident was confirmed by the media office of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also noted that the insects released were not carrying malaria.</blockquote>

Because that would be wrong. Although it would be interesting to see the reaction to <i>that</i>. Maybe Gates was trying to emulate Steve Jobs' famous "reality distortion field" and got it horribly wrong.
