Stephen Hawking, quoted in <em>Wired</em> (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/stephen-hawking-best-quotes/">"Stephen Hawking's best quotes"</a>)

<blockquote>A model is a good model if first it interprets a wide range of observations in terms of a simple and elegant model, and second if the model makes definite predictions that can be tested, and possibly falsified, by observation.</blockquote>
