This is going around from people who think it's hipster and cool and ought to know better: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/jan/15/artist-sets-up-installation-in-namibian-desert-to-play-africa-by-toto-for-all-eternity-video">"Africa by Toto to play 'for all eternity' in Namib desert - video"</a>.

<blockquote>'I … wanted to pay the song the ultimate homage and physically exhibit 'Africa' in Africa,' Siedentopf told NPR. 'The Namibian desert — which is, with 55 million years, the oldest desert in the world — seemed to be the perfect spot for this.'</blockquote>

I like Toto's "Africa", but this is graffiti on the Mona Lisa. I hope somebody finds this thing and eliminates it with extreme prejudice.
