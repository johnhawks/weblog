And now for <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/10/02/2009-10-02_book_reveals_chilling_details_of_how_cryonic_lab_thumped_remains_of_baseball_imm.html">something completely different</a>: 

<blockquote>Johnson writes that holes were drilled in Williams' severed head for the insertion of microphones, then frozen in liquid nitrogen while Alcor employees recorded the sounds of Williams' brain cracking 16 times as temperatures dropped to -321 degrees Fahrenheit.

Johnson writes that the head was balanced on an empty can of Bumble Bee tuna to keep it from sticking to the bottom of its case.

Johnson describes watching as another Alcor employee removed Williams' head from the freezer with a stick, and tried to dislodge the tuna can by swinging at it with a monkey wrench.</blockquote>

OK, let's be honest. It may seem disrespectful to use a tuna can, but when it comes down to it, it's an appropriately-sized cryonic-resistant armature. It's not like you can dip just any old thing into liquid nitrogen. And "Bumble Bee" is just one of those details that makes it sound comically creepy. I mean, like it would be any better if it were "Chicken of the Sea." It's probably green to recycle this way. 

Now in retrospect, the brain cracking should have been an obvious outcome. And why a "monkey wrench"? Did they just happen to have one laying around for tuna can removal?
