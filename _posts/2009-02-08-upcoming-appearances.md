I will be giving two public lectures out of town later this week. 

The biggest is this Thursday evening, February 12, when I will be giving the Darwin Day lecture at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. This is a really great venue, and I'm really looking forward to it! So I'm bringing out all the good stuff: 

<b>Neandertals, Darwin and the Sicilian Mafia: What do they have in common?</b>

If you're in the SE Wisconsin area, the lecture is Thursday 2/12, at 7:00 pm, in the Young Auditorium at UWW. 

Earlier in the week, on Wednesday, I'll be giving a lecture in the Human Genetics department at the University of Chicago. This talk will cover some of my current research on recent selection in humans, as well as the connections between our evolutionary history and documented written history. The title is: 

<b>Spatial dynamics of positive selection, language dispersals, and human history</b>

If you're familiar with UC, you're ahead of me in finding the place. The talk will be Wednesday 2/11, at 4:00 pm in CLSC 101.
