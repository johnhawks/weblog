Anthropology.net reports on new work by Fran&ccedil;ois Paquay and colleagues that casts more doubt on the Younger Dryas impact event (<a href="http://anthropology.net/2009/12/09/the-clovis-comet-that-wasnt-mystery-deepens/">"The Clovis comet that wasn't? Mystery deepens"</a>). I wrote about another paper by Todd Surovell and colleagues earlier this fall (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/climate/extinction-younger-dryas-impact-surovell-2009.html">"The Younger Dryas impact fizzle?"</a>). 

Why am I interested? There were several events during the Pleistocene that may have affected global climate -- the Toba volcano stands out, but there are others also. It is really difficult to test whether these events actually affected human populations, however -- the quality of evidence we have is very poor. But the Younger Dryas is recent enough that we have a lot more power to test the hypothesis that humans were affected by an impact. 

Problem is, the geologists seem to disagree about whether an impact even happened! 

I try to keep this in mind, when we see other reports (from a single event, or even a single core of lake sediments) that massive climate catastrophes must have decimated ancient human populations.
