A piece on my desktop that I've been meaning to blog is by Sarah Zielinsky in <em>National Geographic News</em>: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121012-neanderthals-science-paabo-dna-sex-breeding-humans/">"Neanderthals ... They're Just Like Us?"</a>. Several good quotes including one from me, here's one from John Shea:

<blockquote>"It's increasingly difficult to point to any one thing that Neanderthals did and Homo sapiens didn't do and vice versa," said John Shea, an archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These Ice Age people, both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, survived, thrived, and increased their numbers under conditions that would probably kill people nowadays, even ones that are equipped with modern survival technology."</blockquote>
