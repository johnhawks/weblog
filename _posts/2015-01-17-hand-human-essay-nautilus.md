Last year I published an essay in _Nautilus_, titled <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/are-humans-the-greatest-things-created-by-the-human-hand">"Are humans the greatest things created by the human hand?"</a>. The article has been making the rounds on social media this week, so I thought others might be interested in seeing the link again: 

<blockquote>Psychologists studying learning in human children and chimpanzee juveniles have found that a key difference between our two species is the ability to share attention jointly with another, more experienced individual. When a mother holds a toy in her hands and names it, the child can learn that word. When a mother points at the toy later on, the child will understand. By directing attention with our hands, early humans may have laid the groundwork for spoken language.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And now, we type and text.</blockquote>

The first part of the essay considers the way that _Homo habilis_ was interpreted as the first hominin with humanlike hands, and the shift brought by the humanlike hand of _Australopithecus sediba_.
