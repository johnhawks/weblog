Eugenie Scott <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/09/eugenie-scott-r.html#more">watched the <i>Creation</i> movie with NCSE</a>, and posted a review. 

<blockquote><i>Creation</i> is first and foremost a movie about the relationship between Charles and Emma. The actors, married in real life, and themselves parents, do an excellent job portraying the range of emotions that must have been part of the Darwins life togetherfrom tenderness as they hold their baby Annie, through their shared grief over her death, to the tension over their different attitudes towards religion, and other aspects of their relationship.</blockquote>
