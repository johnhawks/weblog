As the new school year ramps up, if you are teaching human evolution as part of your courses, Caitlin Schrein has been tweeting some helpful resource links. Her post from last year, <a href="http://paleophile.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/human-evolution-education-resources/">"Human Evolution Education Resources"</a>, provides a broad cross-section of links from around the web. 

More recently, PBS has a page full of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/search/results/page/1/include-all/N?q=&x=0&y=0&facet[0]=dc.subject%3A%22Evolution%22&facet[]=dc.type%3A%22Full+Episode%22"><em>NOVA</em> online videos pertinent to human evolution</a>. You can stream full episodes of many good recent documentaries, including the three-part "Becoming Human" series from 2009.
