From a piece in <i>The Tennesseean</i>, worthy of a place in the <i>Onion</i> except it's apparently serious: <a href="http://blogs.tennessean.com/opinion/2010/11/14/bloggers-uncrafted-output-completely-self-serving/">"Internet bloggers uncrafted output completely self-serving"</a>

<blockquote>Some bloggers act like literary versions of Dr. Frankenstein: They use publication to breathe life into malformed ideas. Even if people never had better thoughts than they have today, only a few of them ought to be preserved. The proper fate of the rest is to remain the secret possession of ordinary minds and to accompany their owners quietly to the grave. Of course, we are free not to read the blogs that addle the brain. But to know they do, we have to read them and as a result fill our heads with worth less chatter.</blockquote>

A true philosopher, that.
