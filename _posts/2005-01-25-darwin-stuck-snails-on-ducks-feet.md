Who'd'a thunk it? <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11022936">This story from LiveScience</a> explains all. 
</p>

<blockquote>The study, published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, indicates that <i>Balea</i> snails somehow traveled from Europe to the Azores and evolved into two different species. Then, some packed up and headed 5,500 miles south to Tristan da Cunha, where they further differentiated into eight more species.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, <i>Balea</i> snails from Tristan returned to Europe, where until recently they have been mistaken as the <i>Baleaperversa</i> snails that made that original trip.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The question remains, though, how did these snails cross the ocean?</blockquote>

They're guessing birds, but have no idea which. But the question of snail dispersal to islands evidently interested Darwin enough to experiment a bit with them -- according to the story, at least; I haven't had any luck finding a reference to it in Darwin's writings.

UPDATE (1/30/2006): A reader e-mails <a href="http://snailstales.blogspot.com/2005/12/flying-mollusks.html">a post with the citation!</a> Turns out there's <a href="http://snailstales.blogspot.com/">a whole blog devoted to snails!</a> That is cool.
