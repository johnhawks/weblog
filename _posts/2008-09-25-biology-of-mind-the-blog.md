I am doing a unique experiment with my course this semester, "Biology of Mind." The course has a history of collaborative peer review on writing assignments, and the students do a lot of writing -- students who earn an "A" in the course will be required to produce 10,000 words of written assignments during the semester. In the past, I have used the university's online course system to administer the assignments, and the students have really benefited from their peers' feedback as well as my own. 

This semester, I've decided to take it all public. The students are collaborating as before, except this semester they are doing it on a blog. The <a href="http://biologyofmind.johnhawks.net/">blog's name is "Biology of Mind"</a>, and it has been up and running for a couple of weeks. Right now there are over 200 posts over there, and the number continues to grow. 

The students write weekly reviews of papers in psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, philosophy of mind, and naturally anthropology -- a broad scope. Many of the students have been following new research, others have chosen to delve more deeply into the history of one or more fields. In any event, if you're interested in the brain, you may like this site. I think the students (mostly seniors with some graduate students) are producing some nice work, and the site is open for feedback from the public as well. 

So <a href="http://biologyofmind.johnhawks.net/">check it out</a>, and if you like the site, please spread the word!

UPDATE (2008/09/26): Wow, that was such a tremendous increase in traffic that the server went down. I'm fixing it now, and in the meantime directing traffic here (so you'll see the message). This shouldn't take long, once the DNS setting propagates....

UPDATE (30 minutes later): Now fixed. I laid on some aggressive caching to cut the database requests; should be smooth sailing from here on out.
