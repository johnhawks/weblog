My hometown <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48012442/ns/weather/#.T-4e-ph3qfR">made the news yesterday:</a>

<blockquote>On Thursday, Norton, Kan., was the hottest spot in the nation, topping out at 118 degrees, according to the National Climatic Data Center. Over the previous five days, another Kansas town, Hill City, held that spot, reaching 115 degrees on Wednesday.</blockquote>

Hill City and Norton don't really have a strong rivalry, so I don't imagine either of them would mind giving up this title to the other.
