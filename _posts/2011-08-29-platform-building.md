Seth Godin: <a href="http://www.thedominoproject.com/2011/07/strangers-and-friends-understanding-publishing.html">"Strangers and friends: understanding publishing"</a>. 

<blockquote>Its very seductive for an author to believe that a fairy godmother will introduce her fabulous idea to legions of strangers. Seductive, yes, but rarely something that actually happens.</blockquote>

The point: Build your own platform.
