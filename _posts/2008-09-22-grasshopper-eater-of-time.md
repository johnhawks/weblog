<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26794931/">Cool clock:</a>

<blockquote>Most clocks just tell time, simply and reliably. Not the $1.8 million "time eater" formally unveiled Friday at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The masterpiece, introduced by famed cosmologist Stephen Hawking, challenges all preconceptions about telling time. It has no hands or digital numbers and it is specially designed to run in erratic fashion, slowing down and speeding up from time to time.</blockquote>

It has a giant monstrous grasshopper on top that devours time as it ratchets the clock forward.
