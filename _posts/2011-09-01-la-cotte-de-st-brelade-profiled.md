The BBC is running a nice article about the ongoing excavations on the island of Jersey at La Cotte de St. Brelade. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14677434">"Neanderthal survival story revealed in Jersey caves"</a>. 

<blockquote>La Cotte's collapsed cave system contains intact ice age sediments spanning a quarter of a million years, revealing a detailed sequence of Neanderthal occupation and occasional abandonment, against a background of changing climate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The site is the most exceptional long-term record of Neanderthal behaviour in North West Europe," says Dr Matt Pope from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London.</blockquote>

It's a neat site and the Beeb are doing an episode of "Digging for Britain" about it this month.
