**Notable paper:** Smith TM, Tafforeau P, Le Cabec A, Bonnin A, Houssaye A, et al. (2015) Dental Ontogeny in Pliocene and Early Pleistocene Hominins. PLoS ONE 10(2): e0118118. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118118">doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0118118</a>

**Synopsis:** Tanya Smith and colleagues report on the largest-ever study based on synchotron scanning of juvenile teeth from early hominin species. They examined 25 specimens that represent _Australopithecus anamensis_ (from Kanapoi, Kenya), _Au. africanus_ (from Sterkfontein and Makapansgat, South Africa), _Paranthropus robustus_ (from Swarkrans and Drimolen, South Africa), and early _Homo_ (species unidentified, from Drimolen, South Africa). They examined the growth increments of the teeth, showing that these early hominin samples have a substantial variation in the periodicity and formation time of their molar crowns. 

**Interesting because:** We would like to know more about the growth and development of fossil hominins. The formation of enamel in teeth happens at a characteristic rate, leaving growth increments that can be examined microscopically. The synchotron scans allow this enamel formation to be studied non-destructively. Up to now, conclusions about the growth rate of early hominin teeth have been based on very small samples. Looking at the larger sample has yielded a broader picture of variation, while supporting differences among species (like the apparently faster development of _P. robustus_ teeth. 

**More:** The teeth in this study all come from juvenile specimens, and yield a more precise estimate of age at time of death for them. Some of them were surprisingly older than originally thought, some younger. Again, the better data yield a picture of variability. It's great that the authors put this into the open access _PLoS ONE_ so that it can be widely read, because it's a good empirical paper.
