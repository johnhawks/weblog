Jonah Lehrer in <i>Wired</i> has a long profile of Robert Sapolsky and his work on stress in baboons: <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/07/ff_stress_cure/all/1">"Under Pressure: The Search for a Stress Vaccine"</a>

<blockquote>Sapolsky slowly introduced himself to a troop of baboons, letting them adjust to his presence. After a few weeks, he began recognizing individual animals, giving them nicknames from the Old Testament. It was a way of rebelling against his childhood Hebrew-school teachers, who rejected the blasphemy of Darwinian evolution. I couldnt wait for the day that I could record in my notebook that Nebuchanezzar and Naomi were off screwing in the bushes, Sapolsky wrote in A Primates Memoir. It felt like a pleasing revenge.</blockquote>
