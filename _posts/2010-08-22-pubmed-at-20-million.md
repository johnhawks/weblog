<a href="http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/">Twenty Million Papers in PubMed: A Triumph or a Tragedy?</a>

<blockquote>Thats a lot of data and its growing at a rate of about one paper per minute (on average).</blockquote>

A full list of "triumphs" and "tragedies" at the link. I'm not too worried about the proliferation of noise, but wish that something could be done about the problem of non-unique author names.
