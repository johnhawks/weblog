Earlier in the week, I wrote about the new interpretation of fossil teeth from Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/afarensis/mille/woranso-mille-haile-selassie-2009.html">"Woranso-Mille: A ladder not a bush"</a>). There was one aspect of the paper that I wanted to comment at some greater length: Why didn't the paper include comparisons with the Lomekwi sample of teeth and mandibles? 


The Lomekwi sample includes more teeth than the sample reported from Woranso-Mille. At around 3.5 million years old, Lomekwi is a more relevant comparison than Hadar or Kanapoi, closer in age to Woranso-Mille than any sample other than Laetoli. So why didn't they include the comparison? 

The obvious answer is that these teeth belong to <i>Kenyanthropus platyops</i>, a different species off the line leading from <i>A. anamensis</i> to <i>A. afarensis</i>. So they're not relevant to testing hypotheses about evolution within that lineage. 

But...I don't see why that answer is obvious if <i>Kenyanthropus</i> is a fictitious species, based on a distorted skull (e.g., White 2003). 

Suppose that the teeth don't represent <i>Kenyanthropus</i>. Then they ought to belong to the one cosmopolitan species that exists both north and south of Lomekwi, both earlier and later in time. They ought to be <i>A. afarensis</i>. Which makes them directly relevant to the Woranso-Mille hominins. At the very least, they add to the variation of the <i>A. afarensis</i> sample, helping to inform about the temporal trend in that lineage. 

Besides that, even if we thought that <i>Kenyanthropus</i> was a real taxon, most of the Lomekwi teeth might <i>still</i> be <i>A. afarensis</i>. Only two specimens were assigned to <i>K. platyops</i> by Leakey and colleagues (2001): the KNM-WT 40000 skull and the unassociated maxilla fragment KNM-WT 38350. Both those have relatively small molars compared to the known <i>A. afarensis</i> sample, but in both cases the teeth are broken and dimensions are estimated. The rest of the dental sample is unassociated. The only thing keeping them from being <i>A. afarensis</i> is what we're willing to assume about the number of species at Lomekwi. 

So, it seems like a comparison that ought to be done. The information content is not going to be really high -- we're only talking about gross dimensions of the crowns, and the only ones that look informative at all are upper molars. But Leakey and colleagues argued that the KNM-WT 40000 and KNM-WT 38500 molars are at the very lower end of the range of <i>A. afarensis</i>. Guess what? The Woranso-Mille sample extends this range downward, right around the Lomekwi range. 

Something there...


UPDATE (2009-12-08): I should add that Brown and colleagues (2001) reported additional teeth from Lomekwi and other localities in the Turkana Basin, which they referred to <i>A. afarensis</i> on the basis of their temporal position.  They're not in the Woranso-Mille comparisons either.
