Jason Antrosio has composed a short report on the <a href="http://anthropologyreport.com/anthropology-blogosphere-2013/">"Anthropology Blogosphere 2013  Ecology of Online Anthropology"</a>. I appreciate his kind words about my work here, and love how he has connected the new media activity of many prominent anthropologists, the move to open access by <em>Cultural Anthropology</em>, and the increased activity of social media networks dedicated to connecting anthropologists. It really is an ecology with many niches for people to increase their engagement and connections across fields.
