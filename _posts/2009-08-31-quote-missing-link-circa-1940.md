Some dialogue from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033174/">"Too Many Husbands"</a>, as Melvyn Douglas and Fred MacMurray get on each others' nerves:

Melvyn Douglas: All right, spell "Pithecanthropus erectus." 

Fred MacMurray: Why?

Melvyn Douglas: Because I say you can't. 

Fred MacMurray: All right. P-I-T-H-E-C-A-N-T-H-R-O-P-U-S-E-R-E-C-T-U-S.

Jean Arthur: Is that right?

Melvyn Douglas: Yes. 

Jean Arthur: What is it? 

Melvyn Douglas: It's the missing link between ape and man. Like an athlete. 

And later...

Fred MacMurray: It's my table, I want a steak!

Melvyn Douglas: A glorious night for romance. And you want to tear a cow apart with your teeth!
