NPR did a story this week on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126229305">"mysteries unlocked" by Einstein's brain</a>. Everybody loves to write about Einstein's brain, it's such an easy way to create a carnival atmosphere for your story: 

<blockquote>"He brought out his bags," Paterniti says, "and in one bag he had a Tupperware container in which he had stashed the brain."</blockquote>

The story goes on to describe the study of tissue samples for glial density, as a lead-in to the hypothesis that chemical communication among glial cells is important to certain brain functions. 

I linked to a related story back in the early days of the blog (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/intelligence/witelson_profile_2005.html">"Deep, dark secrets of his and her brains"</a>), which mentioned Einstein's brain as part of a tale about neuron density in male and female brains. A short history of Einstein brain research can be found in a paper by Dean Falk (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704009/">free from PubMed</a>).
