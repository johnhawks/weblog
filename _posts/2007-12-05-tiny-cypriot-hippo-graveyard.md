Believe it or not, I was just talking to someone about dwarf hippos yesterday. And today I run across <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22112045/">this interesting AP article</a> about a dwarf hippo "abattoir" on Cyprus: 
</p>

<blockquote>Paleontologists have unearthed an estimated 80 dwarf hippopotamuses in recent digs at the site located just outside the resort of Ayia Napa on the island's southeastern coast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But possibly hundreds more may be lying beneath an exposed layer of jumbled fossils embedded in the crevices of an ancient coral reef formation that now overlooks the coastline.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Scientists hope the new fossil haul dated to 9,000-11,500 B.C. could offer vital clues to solving the long-standing quandary over when humans first set foot on this east Mediterranean island.</blockquote>

<p>
In a real example of "one-way" evolution, the hippos apparently swum there and then proceeded to lose their aquatic adaptations, becoming run-of-the-mill terrestrial herbivores. 
</p>

<blockquote>Their physical traits also differed. Unlike modern hippos whose upturned nostrils that sit high up on the snout are appropriate for swimming, Cypriot hippos had lower-slung nostrils better suited to foraging on land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to [excavator Ioannis] Panayides, the fossils show the Cypriot hippos had legs and feet adapted to land rather than water, enabling them to stand on their hind legs to reach low-lying tree branches.</blockquote>

<p>
There's quite a bit in the article about the early human habitation of Cyprus, which on the basis of these finds would be pre-Neolithic. Personally, I just like little hippos...
