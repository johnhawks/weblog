This is big education news, from the California legislature: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/education/california-bill-would-force-colleges-to-honor-online-classes.html">"Measure Seeks Campus Credit For Web Study"</a>.

<blockquote>If it passes, as seems likely, it would be the first time that state legislators have instructed public universities to grant credit for courses that were not their own  including those taught by a private vendor, not by a college or university.

We want to be the first state in the nation to make this promise: No college student in California will be denied the right to move through their education because they couldnt get a seat in the course they needed, said Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate, who will introduce the bill. Thats the motivation for this.</blockquote>

So instead of increasing funding to existing campuses at sufficient levels to train the students who are seeking education, California will mandate that online courses from other institutions be accepted as part of the degree requirements at its state universities and community colleges. 

Does that mean I'll soon have Berkeley anthropology students taking my online course for degree credit? We'll see....
