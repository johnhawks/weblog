The day has come when you can raise money for a movie by subscription, and here's an interesting article profiling a project that's trying to put old-style FX back to work: <a href="http://techzwn.com/2011/12/filmmakers-reviving-sci-fi-with-lights-miniatures-and-imagination/">"Filmmakers Reviving Sci-fi With Lights, Miniatures, and Imagination"</a>. I like their attitude. 

<blockquote>Advanced civilizations have descended into dark ages before, its not outside the realm of possibility. So keeping that in mind, I think if you make science-fiction films today, you have an obligation to inspire people to think about exploration and progress and the beauty of scientific pursuits, they said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The problem with many science-fiction films today, according to Van Gorder and Stockmeier, is they fail to address mankind regaining control of its technology when technology reaches highly-advanced levels.</blockquote>

As they say, almost all the sci-fi plots these days are about humans losing control of technology, or unintended consequences. I like the idea of the unintended consequence being someone taking control of her potential.
