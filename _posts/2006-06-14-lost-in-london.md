Safely in Zagreb, now, but on the way via Heathrow (with overnight layover) lost a bag in a taxi! I have made all appropriate inquiries with the police, but in the meantime I figure, if somebody finds it and Googles my name, what will they find? The weblog, of course! So here is my plea: 
</p>

<p>
If you have found my backpack, you can reach me at my e-mail address: 
</p>

<p>
j<!-- obscuring text -->haw<!-- more obscuring text -->ks@w<!-- yes, more <br />
obscuring text -->isc.e<!-- beginning to think I'm OCD, aren't you? -->du 
</p>

<p>
Yes, it will be obvious if the backpack is mine. There will be a reward, depending on the contents.
