I'm reading through the <a href="http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/journal/issues/v77n4/41888/41888.html">recent review article</a> on "The use of racial, ethnic, and ancestral categories in human genetics research," by the "Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group" of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Very official sounding, or anonymous sounding, although the participants in the working group are listed.

<p>
How is it? Here's an indication: I count 205 references. By my count, 11 of these are earlier than 1990.

<p>
Hmm...does that mean it's more up-to-date?
