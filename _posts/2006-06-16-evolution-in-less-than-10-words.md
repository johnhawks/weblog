Razib has <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/06/evolution_in_less_than_10_word.php">a challenge</a>: "If you had 10 words or less, what would you have the public <b>master</b> about evolutionary theory?"
</p>

<p>
Here's a short credo that I give to my students: 
</p>

<b>No evolution means equal offspring for everyone!</b>

<p>
It's not exactly true, of course, since a population with no variance in reproduction can still evolve, drift will still fix alleles. Heck, even if they were clones, there would still be mutations! But it does get you started thinking about how <i>hard</i> it would be to have a population that <i>doesn't</i> evolve. 
</p>

<p>
And that means that evolution is ubiquitous.

<blockquote>Try these 10:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evolution means change; take it or leave it (nature does!)</blockquote>
