Michael Regnier has an article in <em>Mosaic</em> about the exceptional life and tragic end of George Price: <a href="http://mosaicscience.com/story/George-Price-altruism-equation">"The man who gave himself away"</a>.

I found it interesting that <em>Mosaic</em> commissioned the story in light of Oren Harman's recent book about Price, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2d7n389">The Price of Altruism</a></em>, which is also an excellent account. But for a good short read, or for assigning in classes, Regnier's article is a great one.
