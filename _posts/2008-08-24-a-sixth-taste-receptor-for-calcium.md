Do people <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315648/">taste calcium</a>?

<blockquote>By measuring the electrical activity of nerves linking the brain and tongue in mice, "we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted," Tordoff said.</blockquote>

There's an interesting genetic story here, with a high-calcium mouse strain showing activity in a calcium receptor not previously known to be expressed in the tongue. Who knows what other things gene expression studies are going to find?
