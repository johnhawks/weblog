Olivia Judson <a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/darwinmania/index.html">writes about "Darwinmania"</a> at her <i>NY Times</i> blog. There are some interesting historical bits, as you would expect -- the jealousy of other "inventors" of natural selection, and this:

<blockquote>Without the publication of the "Origin" the following year, the meeting at the Linnean Society could well have passed unnoticed, the Darwin-Wallace statements going the same way as those by Matthew and Wells. Indeed, the meeting had so little impact at the time that, at the end of the year, the president of the Linnean Society said, "The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear."</blockquote>

I think this is more generally true than most people realize -- really significant advances are left unremarked until later, because the contemporaries are not able to extend their thinking.
