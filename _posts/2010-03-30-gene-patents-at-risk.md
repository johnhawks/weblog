A Federal court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/business/30gene.html">has thrown out Myriad Genetics' patents</a> on tests for <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations, risk factors in breast and ovarian cancer: 

<blockquote>Judge Sweet, however, ruled that the patents were improperly granted because they involved a law of nature. He said that many critics of gene patents considered the idea that isolating a gene made it patentable a lawyers trick that circumvents the prohibition on the direct patenting of the DNA in our bodies but which, in practice, reaches the same result.</blockquote>

That's huge and surprising news for the biotech industry. Probably it benefits companies positioned to do genome-wide tests of various kinds, which due to the advance of technology are presently much cheaper than Myriad has been charging for its tests.
