From Alexis Madrigal: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/06/hey-brother-can-you-spare-a-hubble-dod-sure-have-two/258061">"Hey, brother, can you spare a Hubble?"</a>

<blockquote>Now, we get word from the Washington Post that the Department of Defense has gifted two better-than-Hubble telescopes to NASA. That's right. Our military had two, unflown, better-than-Hubble space telescopes just sitting around. This story is almost unbelievable; it feels like a hoax. But it's not.</blockquote>

More details are in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-gets-two-military-spy-telescopes-for-astronomy/2012/06/04/gJQAsT6UDV_story.html"><em>Washington Post</em> article</a>. The problem with the gift is that NASA has no budget to actually fly these telescopes and staff their operations. 

I bet the private space ventures could figure out a way to use them...
