In case you thought environmental blitzkrieg was a bad thing, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/arts/12fest.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss"><b>GET READY FOR E. O. WILSON</b></a>


<blockquote>On Saturday theres a chance to play naturalist, scouring a pair of New York parks under professional guidance in what Dr. Wilson calls a BioBlitz for flora, fauna and all things crawly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Sunday night Dr. Wilson will give a talk on his adventures BioBlitzing the world in search of new species.</blockquote>

OH YEAH! GET <b>BLITZED</b> as the ANT KING blasts his way through a <i>MAGINOT LINE</i> of SPECIES! 

Err...well...if blitzkrieg isn't your thing, there's always this: 

<blockquote>Over the next three days the curious will have to make painful choices: attend an investigation of the effects of music on the brain with a performance by Bobby McFerrin, or join a quest for a long-lost mural by Leonardo Da Vinci at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? </blockquote>

Indeed, that <i>is</i> a painful choice. 

In fact, I'm wondering if <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/12/arts/12fest.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss">the whole article</a> by Dennis Overbye isn't a kind of punk on the whole thing. He's got a whole science festival of stuff to write about, and he picks Brian Greene trying to hum the M*A*S*H theme song? Talk about "suicide is painless"!
