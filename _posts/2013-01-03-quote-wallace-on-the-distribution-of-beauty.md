In response to Darwin's claim that the British aristocracy has been made more beautiful "from pick of women", Alfred Russel Wallace replied (in <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-4514">a letter to Darwin written on 29 May 1864</a>):

<blockquote>I very much doubt the often repeated assertion that our aristocracy are more beautiful than the middle classes. I allow that they present specimens of the highest kind of beauty, but I doubt the average.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have noticed in country places a greater average amount of good looks among the middle classes, & besides we unavoidably combine in our idea of beauty, intellectual expression & refinement of manners, which often make the less appear the more beautiful. Mere physical beauty,that is, a healthy & regular development of the body & features approaching to the mean or type of European man,I believe is quite as frequent in one class of society as the other & much more frequent in rural districts than in cities.</blockquote>

In addition to being an admirably Republican sentiment, Wallace's letter is an early statement of the idea that the <em>average</em> physical form is perceived as the most beautiful.
