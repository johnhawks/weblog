Ann Althouse, <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/07/about-that-anthropogenic-global-warming.html">writing about science and politics:</a>

<blockquote>[T]he whole point of science is to question and investigate and test. If scientists close ranks when they think that they have enough evidence and that they will have more influence if they claim consensus, they have moved from science to politics. Yet if we see that scientists don't maintain scientific values, the basis for their influence in politics is, ironically, destroyed. Even if you want to abandon ethics and sell out for what you see as the greater good, it won't even work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Step back from the precipice, scientists! We need you. We have enough politicians.</blockquote>
