Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnhawks/5467157487/" title="Grotte de Bernifal by John Hawks, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5467157487_26840a866b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Grotte de Bernifal" /></a>
</div>

Yeah, that's not a sketch. I've had this painting inside me since last summer and it needed to come out. This is a guide using the portable torch to highlight a pictograph within the Grotte de Bernifal, Dordogne, France.
