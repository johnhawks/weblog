<b>The Termineander</b>

I took this on at the suggestion of a reader. 

Yes, it's a Geico caveman morphed into the ultimate robot assassin from the future. Well, you were wondering how they got all those cranial wounds, weren't you? 

Yes, by drawing a robot in colored pencils, I have become the ultimate high school art geek. 

No, I don't suppose "Neandernator" works quite as well.
