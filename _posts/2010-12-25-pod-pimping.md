Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week author Matt Wedel has two recent posts about the artistic reconstruction of sauropods. The <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/pimp-my-pod-2-haids/">one about head anatomy</a> is especially perceptive. 

<blockquote>I think these are dynamite, because they show that you can avoid shrink-wrapped dinosaur syndrome (SWDS) and still make an anatomically detailed, realistic-looking life restoration. SWDS is what I call the common convention in paleo-art of simply draping the skeletonand especially the skullin Spandex and calling that a life restoration. I think its a popular technique because you can show off the skeleton inside the animal and thereby demonstrate that youve done your homework (especially to an audience that already knows the skeletons*). It gives artists an easy way to add detail to their critters; if you actually slab on realistic soft tissues and lose most of those skeletal and cranial landmarks, you have to come up with something else to make your animals look detailed and visually interesting. And by now its been going strong for several decades, so people expect it.</blockquote>

Yes, hominin reconstructions are also subject to shrink-wrapped syndrome. I'm less critical of that than the "thousand-mile stare" pose that many reconstructions are given. There's more emotion in the Lincoln Memorial. 

Wedel's earlier post, <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/pimp-my-pod/">"Pimp my pod"</a> discusses the idea of "too big for camouflage".
