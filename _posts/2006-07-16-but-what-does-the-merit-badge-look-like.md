Man, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13774258/site/newsweek/">camp has gotten a lot more boring</a> since I was a kid: 
</p>

<blockquote>At the summer camp at Timber-lee Christian Center in East Troy, Wis., for example, campers can go on a seven-room "Creation Walk," where each room showcases one of the Bible's seven days of Creation. Says Karen Good, outdoor education director at Timber-lee, "The curriculum is designed to open their eyes so when they go back to school [and hear about evolution] they say, 'Oh, that sounds goofy!' "</blockquote>

<blockquote>Other camps are fighting back by offering summer programs teaching evolution. In late June, the Unitarian Universalist Church in Fresno, Calif., sponsored the fourth season of Chalice Camp, a science camp that uses song, dance and drama to teach children about scientific discoveries about human origins.</blockquote>

Well, maybe it's better than it sounds. Hey, maybe <i>I should start offering song, dance and drama here!</i> Woo-hoo!
