I have an article in <em>Slate</em>, where I riff on last week's silly suggestion to "bio-engineer humans" to stop climate change: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/03/bioengineering_people_to_fight_global_warming_been_there_done_that_.single.html">"Can Bioengineers Make Human Beings More Sustainable?"</a>

My take: The experiment has already been done!

<blockquote>When the climate warmed by several degrees around 8,000 B.C., it must have seemed at first like a wonderful dream. The glaciers melted. The human population grew and grew. There were more people than ever before, using a broader range of resources and eating a broader range of foods, and they invented beautiful and complex cultures. </blockquote>

<blockquote>That's when these people of the early Holocene did something truly bizarre. They reacted to all this climate change by engineering a new, more sustainable ecology. And they began to foster mutant children who would flourish in an alternate, globally warmed future.</blockquote>

Here's what I find interesting: Bioethicists suggest totalitarian-sounding approaches to genetic change. But with lactase persistence and amylase duplications, nature took a different course:

<blockquote>When it comes to cutting meat, natural selection has acted more like an entrepreneur than a eugenicist. Instead of giving us an aversion to meat, it lures us away from meat by offering a milkshake sweetened with corn syrup.</blockquote>

Of course, that just makes the population grow faster. Only one way to really solve this problem, and yes, my essay goes there...
