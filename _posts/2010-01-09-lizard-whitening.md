Ed Yong reports on a study of pigmentation evolution in the lizards of White Sands, New Mexico: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/three_desert_lizards_evolve_white_skins_through_different_mu.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=channellink">"Three desert lizards evolve white skins through different mutations to the same gene"</a>. 

The gene is <i>MC1R</i>, also responsible for pigment variation in humans and, apparently, Neandertals. That makes for an interesting story of parallelism of pigment loss. Cave fish have recurrently lost pigmentation due to a different gene, homologous to our <i>OCA2</i>, best known as the "blue-eye" gene. It makes me wonder why lizards broke <i>MC1R</i> repeatedly -- were they using their <i>OCA2</i> for something else?
