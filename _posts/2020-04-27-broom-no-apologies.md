Robert Broom, in the first paragraph of his paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/142897a0">"Further Evidence on the Structure of the South African Pleistocene Anthropoids"</a>, says it better than I could.

<blockquote>NO apology need be given for publishing to the world at the earliest possible moment all new evidence that is discovered which seems to throw additional light on the structure of the apes that apparently are related to the ancestors of man. Every month reveals some new facts of importance, and it seems to me better that these should be announced at once, than that they should be held back for perhaps years in the hope of publishing a detailed account.</blockquote>

Next time you hear someone say that "real paleontologists take time to do quality science", you can pull this one out of your pocket.
