Here's a story that showed up in my feed this morning: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/14/prehistoric-man-ate-panda-claim">"Prehistoric man ate panda, claims scientist"</a>. 

<blockquote>Wei Guangbiao said prehistoric man ate the bears in what is now part of the city of Chongqing in south-west China.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wei, head of the Institute of Three Gorges Paleoanthropology at a Chongqing museum, said excavated panda fossils "showed that pandas were once slashed to death by man".</blockquote>

This really wouldn't be very surprising, as occasional evidence of human predation or consumption of other carnivores, including bears in Europe, goes way back.
