<p>
If you are coming by because you heard the address on <a href="http://www.wpr.org/higherground/">WPR's "Higher Ground" with Jonathan Overby</a>, let me wish you a warm welcome. Feel free to explore a bit. 
</p>

<p>
I have a <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/liang_bua.html">FAQ about the Flores hominids</a>, or you can go to <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/">the full listing about Flores</a>, which includes the latest news about the damage to the fossils and my opinion about what the fossils represent. 
</p>

<p>
The weblog is a combination of news in human evolution, my own research and reviews, and thoughts about our place in nature. I try to update often, and include as much "behind the scenes" information about new finds as I can. I also have a number of posts relating to the <a href="weblog/topics/creation/">teaching of evolution in schools</a>. Some of the material is a little technical, because I keep my own notes here; but I refer the site to all my students, so I try to keep it accessible. 
</p>

<p>
If you're a teacher in Wisconsin public schools and would like to find out more about human evolution, please let me know. You'll find my email address on <a href="http://www.anthropology.wisc.edu/facstaff.htm#Hawks">my faculty listing</a> at the UW anthropology department. (Why don't I provide a direct mailto:// link? To cut down the spam, of course!)
