I'm writing this post live from the Kaleidoscope program here at UW. My part of today's program is a workshop on sharing your work with the world, using blogs and other online tools. 

For participants (or others), I thought I would provide a couple of links. I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/tenure-blog-prosper-2008.html">wrote about blogging and tenure</a> here last year, a post that <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/blogging-tenure-part-2-2008.html">I followed up with a second part</a>, but I haven't yet finished the series. 

An <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/slate_boynton_blogging_tenure_2005.html">earlier post</a> also pointed to <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2130466/">a 2005 article in <i>Slate</i> on the topic</a>, along with some other articles.
