<i>New Scientist</i> has <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126905.000-ten-extinct-beasts-that-could-walk-the-earth-again.html?full=true&print=true">a primer on extinct animals</a> that might be candidates for resurrection by cloning. My preference is the short-faced bear: 

<blockquote>This towering beast would dwarf the world's largest living land carnivore, the polar bear. The short-faced bear may have been a third taller than the polar bear when standing upright, and it weighed up to a tonne. Recovering its DNA should be possible as there are specimens encased in permafrost. The short-faced's closest living relative is the spectacled bear of South America. The two species parted evolutionary company only around 5 million years ago, but unfortunately, at just a tenth the body mass of the short-faced bear, the spectacled bear is unlikely to be a particularly good surrogate.</blockquote>

Or, OH OH, the giant beaver: 

<blockquote>There is fierce controversy over the reintroduction of normal beavers in some countries, so imagine how much fuss there would be over the reintroduction of the 2.5-metre-long giant beaver to North America. It's not too much to hope for a genome sequence of this massive rodent, says Hendrik Poinar, a geneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. The capybara, which is about half the mass, would probably be the most suitable surrogate, though it might still be too distant a relative.</blockquote>

It's too bad <i>Paleocaster</i> is too old -- their spiral burrows ("devil's corkscrews") are totally cool. 

The article ends on the depressing note that the first resurrected species will likely be one that is now living -- gorillas are the example mentioned. Since the <a href="http://environmentalcommons.org/cetos/articles/cloninggaur.html">cloning of the gaur</a>, that scenario seems pretty likely.
