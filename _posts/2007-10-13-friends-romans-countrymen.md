Has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/technology/technology.html?in_article_id=487039&in_page_id=1965">this guy</a> gone over the edge?
</p>

<blockquote>Performance artists are known for pushing the bounderies, but one Australian has astonished his contemporaries by having a third ear implanted onto his arm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Cypriot-born eccentric Stelios Arcadious spent 10 years searching for a surgeon willing to perform the controversial operation.</blockquote>

Why is it that when I heard about this story, I started hearing the song, "Papa can you hear me?" in my head?
</p>

<blockquote>"I hope to have a tiny microphone implanted to it that will connect with a bluetooth transmitter; that way you can listen to what my ear is hearing."</blockquote>

<p>
Uhhh...if they are the same voices that this guy must be hearing in his head, that will be kind of scary.
