Moon rock is expensive here on Earth, but on the moon it's as cheap as dirt. So maybe <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2012/11/3-d-printed-moon-rocks/">future moon colonists could make stuff out of it using 3-d printing technology</a>? 

<blockquote>Typically, lasers use 300 to 400 watts to melt conductive metals. But the moon material was more similar to ceramics  Bandyopadhyays area of expertise. He had used that material for 3-D printing through selective laser sintering, where a powder is fused  with intensely focused pulses of light, layer by layer, to form a specific object. He knew that throwing metal-specific levels of power at an insulator like this would only cause most of the energy to be absorbed, and the molten material to lose viscosity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you go higher, then what will happen is you will go from honey to water, and then what happens? says Bandyopadhyay. It flows so much that you cannot make a part. So you need to have, you know, high enough to melt, but low enough not to overflow, basically. Thats the challenge.</blockquote>

Now imagining casts made from lunar regolith. 

I hate the idea of having to depend on tools made from an inferior material, when slightly greater expense and more time could transport metals from the asteroid belt. Oh, wait a minute - that's the basic tradeoff of Oldowan technology in Africa, isn't it?
