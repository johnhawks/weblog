Lots of cave paintings in Europe depict animals now extinct. Australian researchers have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/31/2913350.htm">recently identified a rock painting</a> as a depiction of the extinct thunder duck <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Genyornis-newtoni"><i>Genyornis</i></a>: 

<blockquote>Scientists say an Aboriginal rock art depiction of an extinct giant bird could be Australia's oldest painting.

The red ochre painting, which depicts two emu-like birds with their necks outstretched, could date back to the earliest days of settlement on the continent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Archaeologist Ben Gunn said the giant birds became extinct more than 40,000 years ago.</blockquote>

OK, it's not <i>strictly</i> a duck, it's a stem anseriform. It could be the oldest painting anywhere.
