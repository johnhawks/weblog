I read <a href="http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/2007/05/mystery_in_a_po.html">this post</a> by Grant McCracken some months ago, and I wanted to remind myself of it on September 1. So here it is: 
</p>

<blockquote>You can't imagine soldiers (prisoners?) coming here and knocking down thousands upon thousands of grave stones.And what if you did imagine it? You'd be trapped and you couldn't ever get back.You would have tipped into their insanity or your own.</blockquote>

<p>
OK, that makes the relevance of the date obvious, but there's a poignant story there about an ambiguous headstone that deserves reading.
