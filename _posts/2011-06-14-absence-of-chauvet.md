Some folks have asked me if I would write a review of Werner Herzog's new <i>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</i> movie. Now that I'm back from Europe I would love to do it, but it's not showing anywhere remotely near Madison. That's odd because we usually get first-run art movies when they're released. I don't know when we'll be able to see it but I hope it comes soon!
