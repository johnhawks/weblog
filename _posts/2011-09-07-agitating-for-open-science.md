Cameron Neylon in <em>New Scientist</em>: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128285.600-cameron-neylon-time-for-total-scientific-openness.html">"Time for total scientific openness"</a>.

<blockquote>Above all, you should care because science thrives on new ideas and critical analysis, wherever they come from. Open science is better science. There will be growing pains as we figure out how best to enable that. But if we believe that science enriches society then we must accept that society can, and perhaps should, enrich our research. And that can only happen if it is open.</blockquote>

Open science will not work unless it is better science. I think it will be better. I think the history in paleoanthropology shows very clearly that keeping results behind closed doors for years is not good enough. The results speak for themselves.

We're already getting some incredible feedback on the <a href="/malapa">Malapa Soft Tissue Project</a>, and it has just gotten started. If you've got a lead and haven't written yet, why not?
