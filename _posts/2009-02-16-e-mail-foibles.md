I've just finished cleaning up more than 1000 messages left in my 2008 e-mail inbox. I am always careful to say in my FAQ that I don't respond to every e-mail -- with some 400 students and 4 children, I have to let some things slide or I would never have time to post. Still, I try to reply to those who brave the internets to find me -- if only to thank them. 

So if you've e-mailed and didn't hear back, please accept my apologies and thanks. Except for the guy who wrote about Jesus and the Rosicrucians. No chance I was going to reply to that one.
