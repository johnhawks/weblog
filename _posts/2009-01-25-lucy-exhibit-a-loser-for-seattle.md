Has Lucy become <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090125/ap_on_sc/who_loves_lucy">a white elephant for museums</a>?

<blockquote>Halfway through the five-month exhibit, the Pacific Science Center faces a half-million-dollar loss resulting in layoffs of 8 percent of the staff, furloughs and a wage freeze, President Bryce Seidl said Friday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The center had hoped to draw 250,000 visitors during the exhibit that ends March 8, but only 60,000 have come. Seidl blamed the recession, which has cut into arts and museum revenue nationwide, as well as December snowstorms that curtailed travel within and around Seattle.</blockquote>
