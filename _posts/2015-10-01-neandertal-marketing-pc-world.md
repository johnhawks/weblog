From <em>PC World</em>: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/237022/Neanderthals.html">"Neanderthals vs. Homo sapiens - Lessons Learned"</a>

<blockquote>CNN recently reported that Neanderthals were as smart as Homo sapiens. Sure, they were as smart, but they routinely shipped their products two years after Homo sapiens did, with a minimum of usability testing. And Neanderthals depended on income from previous products, such as bowls, when fire first came out. Neanderthals' VP of Marketing freely admitted as much: “We didn't see fire coming. We were so focused on our new model of bowls, we missed fire completely.”</blockquote>

This is too charming for the Neandertal anti-defamation files. And yes, I've corrected all the species names in this; I cannot abide miscapitalization of Linnaean binomials.
