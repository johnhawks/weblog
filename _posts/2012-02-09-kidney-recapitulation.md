Jerry Coyne reviews a case of recapitulation in human embryonic and fetal development: <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/evidence-for-evolution-development-of-our-kidneys/">"Evidence for evolution: development of our kidneys"</a>. 

<blockquote>One example is the development of the human kidney, which is pretty much the same as the development of any mammalian kidney.  It turns out that, in utero, we develop three separate kidneys in succession, absorbing the first two before we wind up with the embryonic kidney that will become our adult kidney.  The first two of these reprise embryonic kidneys of ancestral forms, and in the proper evolutionary order.</blockquote>

Yesterday during my Anthropology 105 lecture, I was discussing the successive replacement of different hemoglobin forms in embryonic and fetal development. This is not a case of recapitulation, but instead elaboration of function upon the duplication of genes. Amazing how complex the physiological solutions allowing normal development can be, each of them drawing upon the legacy of genes shared with ancient organisms.
