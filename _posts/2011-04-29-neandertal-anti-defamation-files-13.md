From <i>The Economist</i>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18620710">"What's wrong with America's economy?"</a>

<blockquote>Of course, plenty more could be done to spur innovation. The system of corporate taxation is a mess and deters domestic investment. Mr Obama is right that Americas infrastructure is creaking (see article). <b>But the solution there has as much to do with reforming Neanderthal funding systems as it does with the greater public spending he advocates.</b> Too much of the competitiveness talk is a canardone that justifies misguided policies, such as subsidies for green technology, and diverts attention from the countrys real to-do list.</blockquote>

<i>There's a Neanderthal funding system?!</i> Holy lucre, Batman! 

Obviously if the Neanderthal funding system isn't directing government funding to my lab, it is badly in need of reform! 

Or...wait a minute. We all know that Her Majesty's Secret Service has information the rest of us don't. What if they've stumbled onto a black op Neanderthal project? OMG, THE CLONES!

I swear, I won't tell a soul. Just bring me under the Neanderthal funding umbrella. It's classified.
