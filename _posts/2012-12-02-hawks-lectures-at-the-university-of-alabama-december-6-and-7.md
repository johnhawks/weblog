I will be traveling south this week to give a pair of lectures at the University of Alabama. On Thursday night, I will be giving a lecture in the ALLELE (ALabama LEctures on Lifes Evolution) seminar series. The lecture will be in the Biology Building Auditorium (room 127) at 7:30 pm. This is a big public lecture, and if you're in the area, I encourage you to come. 

The title is <strong>"Neandertime:  How Ancient Genomes are Transforming our Past and Present"</strong>. I'll be reviewing the science of Neandertals and Denisovans, some of the work we've been doing here in our research group on these ancient people, and how ancient genomes are beginning to yield new insights about the biology of living people.

The ALLELE lectures are really one of the premier lecture series in biology, anywhere in the world. For some perspective, Christopher Lynn reviewed <a href="http://evostudies.org/2012/04/allele-alabama-lectures-on-lifes-evolution/">last year's ALLELE lectures in a post on EvoS</a>, with a great list of wonderful speakers. It's really humbling for me to be included on <a href="http://www.as.ua.edu/evolution/information-about-the-2012-2013-speakers/">this year's list</a>, along with two other prominent scientists and a humanist engaged with evolutionary biology including Edward O. Wilson, Bruce MacFadden and Joe Carroll. The interdisciplinary evolution perspective is something we try to promote here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, because it's a great way to explore commonalities and threads of connections that deepen others' engagement in our evolutionary history. 

On Friday afternoon, I'll be giving a smaller lecture for the Anthropology Department, on human evolution during the Holocene. That lecture is at 3:00 pm in ten Hoor Hall, room 22.

If you're a reader in the area, I hope to meet you there!
