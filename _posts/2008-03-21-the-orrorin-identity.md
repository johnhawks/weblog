There's nothing especially surprising about the functional interpretations in Richmond and Jungers' paper about the <i>Orrorin</i> BAR 1002'00 femur. They conclude it was an australopithecine-like biped, because it shared several features with australopithecine femora: in particular, it has a long, narrow, anteroposteriorly flattened neck and a broad thick proximal shaft. 
</p>

<p>
In this, they mirror the conclusions of the original description of the Lukeino fossils by Senut et al. (2001). Richmond and Jungers also reiterate the evidence for arboreality in the Lukeino fossils, including the well-developed musculature of the distal humerus and the chimpanzee-like curved finger bone. I wonder why their analysis could not have made something more out of the other two femoral fragments, one of which is fairly large (but lacking the head). Still, the paper reiterates the quite good evidence for bipedality in the most complete femoral specimen. 
</p>

<p>
I wonder sometimes how closely people actually read the papers they comment on. The associated coverage, including Ann Gibbons' article, has made a lot out of a small point in the paper, but I think that the commenters have it wrong. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the story: When the <i>Orrorin</i> materials were first published, Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford put forward the argument that these may be more closely related to <i>Homo</i> than to known australopithecines. They based their argument mainly on <i>Orrorin's</i> relatively thick-enameled molars, which they viewed as different from the thin-enameled molars of <i>Ardipithecus</i>, but lacking the enlarged dentition of <i>Australopithecus</i>. So, they suggested that <i>Orrorin</i> might be a plesiomorphic ancestor of <i>Homo</i>, and that <i>Ardipithecus</i> and <i>Australopithecus</i> represent divergent lineages derived in their dental anatomy.
</p>

<p>
I don't find that suggestion very compelling, because it seems to put too much faith in the absence of evolutionary reversals. There's no reason why a large-molared australopithecine should not have given rise to small-molared <i>Homo</i>, particularly since smaller-toothed <i>Homo habilis</i> is apparently derived from earlier, larger-toothed <i>"Homo"</i> specimens like A. L. 666-1 and Omo 75-14. And Haile-Selassie, Suwa and White (2004) claimed that the <i>Orrorin</i>, <i>Sahelanthropus</i>, and <i>Ardipithecus</i> dentitions were so similar that they might represent one taxon. So the dental contrasts among these early hominids are probably not great enough to justify the idea that <i>Orrorin</i> is an exclusive <i>Homo</i> ancestor. 
</p>

<p>
The femur also formed a part of this phylogenetic story, with Senut and Pickford having noted the lack of extreme australopithecine-like features in the femur. The <i>Orrorin</i> femur has a less exaggerated neck length than many australopithecine specimens, it is larger than many, and appears to have a higher neck-shaft angle. To the extent those features differ from later <i>Australopithecus</i>, they resemble the human anatomy. 
</p>

<p>
Richmond and Jungers address this argument very briefly in their last paragraph, by noting that the <i>functional</i> elements of the <i>Orrorin</i> femoral anatomy are entirely consistent with the australopithecine pattern of bipedality:
</p>

<blockquote>The similarity between <i>O. tugenensis</i> and australopith femora weakens support for scenarios in which <i>O. tugenesis</i> is ancestral to <i>Homo</i> to the exclusion of <i>A. afarensis</i> (4). Instead, the overall primitive hominin morphology of the <i>O. tugenensis</i> femur, along with primitive dental anatomy, is consistent with the more parsimonious hypothesis that it is a basal member of the hominin clade.</blockquote>

<p>
I think that's fair, as far as it goes. The overall morphological pattern of this femur, with its long neck and broad shaft, is much like known australopithecine femora. But to go a bit further, their metric comparisons show BAR 1002'00 to be the most <i>Homo</i>-like of the early hominid femora they examined, and their phenetic cluster puts it basal to the other australopithecines. That's pretty much exactly what Senut et al. have consistently said. So I have a hard time understanding how those observations <i>refute</i> the idea that <i>Orrorin</i> has a more <i>Homo</i>-like femur than later australopithecines! 
</p>

<p>
Again, I don't put much stock in the phylogenetic argument for an <i>Orrorin</i>-<i>Homo</i> link. I don't see any difficulty deriving <i>Homo</i> from <i>Australopithecus</i>, especially given the likely effects of body size evolution on the locomotor pattern. And at least one or two early <i>Homo</i> femoral specimens, like KNM-ER 1481, share most of the <i>Australopithecus</i>-like pattern of proximal femur anatomy. But this paper surely doesn't add anything new to the critique of Senut and Pickford's preferred phylogenetic hypothesis. The details simply don't detract from their story.
