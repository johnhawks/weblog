I was reading this <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0,71364-0.html?tw=rss.index"><i>Wired</i> article</a> about DARPA research on visual perception...
</p>

<blockquote>A new brain-computer-interface technology could turn our brains into automatic image-identifying machines that operate faster than human consciousness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Researchers at Columbia University are combining the processing power of the human brain with computer vision to develop a novel device that will allow people to search through images ten times faster than they can on their own.</blockquote>

<p>
...and thinking, "Gee, wouldn't this be handy for research": 
</p>

<blockquote>The brain emits a signal as soon as it sees something interesting, and that "aha" signal can be detected by an electroencephalogram, or EEG cap. While users sift through streaming images or video footage, the technology tags the images that elicit a signal, and ranks them in order of the strength of the neural signatures. Afterwards, the user can examine only the information that their brains identified as important, instead of wading through thousands of images.</blockquote>

<p>
You know, if it could automatically highlight interesting parts of papers. And then search through other papers for similar passages by keywords. And spring them all up on a really big screen. And put them all in the bibliography automatically. 
</p>

<p>
Or maybe you'd just connect all the links to your own paper at the end, and call it a "brainiography". 
</p>

<p>
Just think how insulted your colleagues would be if they didn't make it in!
</p>

<p>
I guess the next logical step would be tracking the "aha" signals for peer review...
