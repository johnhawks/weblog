From Ewen Callaway: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/norway-to-bring-cancer-gene-tests-to-the-clinic-1.9949">"Norway is set to become the first country to incorporate genome sequencing into its national health-care system."</a>

<blockquote>In its three-year pilot phase, the Norwegian Cancer Genomics Consortium will sequence the tumour genomes of 1,000 patients in the hope of influencing their treatments. It will also look at another 3,000 previously obtained tumour biopsies to get a better idea of the mutations in different cancers, and how they influence a patient's response to a drug. In a second phase, the project will build the laboratory, clinical and computing infrastructure needed to bring such care to the 25,000 Norwegians who are diagnosed with cancer each year.</blockquote>

Expect to see much, much more of this.
