<i>Scientific American</i> asks: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=human-microbiome-change&page=3">"What happens when the microbes that keep us healthy disappear?"</a>

If we're starting a pool, I want to put my money on, "nothing much." 

The article is interesting -- it describes how people are trying to unravel the "microbial ecology" of the human microbiome, and how new sequencing technologies are rapidly accelerating the research. 

I think it goes a bit into science fiction by combining these with the "clean childhoods cause allergies" hypothesis, generating the idea that modern life and antibiotics may cause extinctions of gut flora. So far, there's little evidence that losing a microbial species has any negative health impact. The article mentions that widespread vaccination against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> may create an opening for more <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections, but that's hardly an argument against vaccination -- it's an additional reason to find a vaccine for <i>S. aureus</i>. 

UPDATE (2009-12-31): A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/23/tech/main6014559.shtml">nice AP story reviews Norway's method of stamping out MRSA</a>: Don't prescribe antibiotics: 

<blockquote>In Norway, MRSA has accounted for less than 1 percent of staph infections for years. That compares to 80 percent in Japan, the world leader in MRSA; 44 percent in Israel; and 38 percent in Greece. </blockquote>
