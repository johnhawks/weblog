A recent study by Petros and colleagues announced at the meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research (hat tip: <a href="">Dienekes</a>) shows that haplogroup U, which is possessed by around 9.6 percent of Americans, is associated with an increased rate of renal and prostate cancer.

From the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-04/aafc-mdv040705.php">press release</a> on <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org">EurekAlert</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>"We found that 16.7 percent of the prostate cancer patients and 20.7 percent of renal cancer patients are from the U haplogroup," Petros noted. "If you are a Caucasian American and are of haplogroup U, you have roughly twofold increased risk over other Caucasian American haplogroups.</blockquote>

Is this at last a reason to sign up for <a href="weblog/reviews/genetics/genographic_project_announcement.html">the Genographic Project</a>? I guess not for me, since they are only doing the mtDNA haplogroup assessment for female samples!
