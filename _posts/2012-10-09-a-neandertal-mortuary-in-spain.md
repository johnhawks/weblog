<em>El Pais</em> has a fascinating story about the Paleolithic sites in the Lozoya river valley: <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/09/23/inenglish/1348403145_969956.html">"A Neanderthal trove in Madrid"</a>.

<blockquote>It was on the floor of Des-Cubierta that the Neanderthal must have placed the dead body of a small child aged two-and-a-half to three years old. They placed two slabs of stone and an aurochs horn on top, and set the body on fire. [Enrique] Baquedano explains that they found some of the child's teeth - they call it a little girl, although they have no scientific evidence of its gender - as well as a piece of coal that turned up just a few days ago and which will enable precise dating. "Complete burials, with a clear structure that allows [researchers] to reconstruct behaviors, is a very rare thing in any part of the world," says [Juan-Luis] Arsuaga, who is also co-director of the excavations at the major prehistoric site of Atapuerca.</blockquote>

This one sounds like an incredible context, if it really is as described.

Arsuaga is author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470851570/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470851570&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20"><em>The Neanderthal's Necklace</em></a>.
