OK, at ScienceOnline2011 I did a little bit of talking about Neandertals represented in art. So this entry in the NAD files truly pains me. 

You see, <a href="http://britneyspearswatcher.com/gossip/Neanderthals-had-more-sex-than-humans-3979844.html">Britney Spears Watcher</a> picked up</a> that story from last year about how digit ratios predict that Neandertals were oversexed. 

<blockquote>Neanderthals may be lampooned as slack-jawed low-brows who could just about wield a heavy club on a good day, but in one important respect they outperformed us: in the number of sex partners.</blockquote>

Well, yes, it is a delicious irony for a blog devoted to <i>Britney Spears</i> to refer to anyone as a "slack-jawed low-brow" with too many sex partners. But that's not what had me concerned. No, it was the accompanying picture: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/neandertal-ken-bump.jpg" height="300" width="500" alt="Neandertal Ken Bump" />
</div>

Dude! They didn't even give him a Ken Bump. 

I mean, really -- I know that Britney Spears fans are always looking for <b>quality family-friendly material</b>, but this is just rude. Plus, I think it's sort of obviously one of those times like when <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/photo_database/image/oprahs_head_transplant/">they put Oprah's head on Ann-Margret's body.</a>  

UPDATE (2011-01-20): Gretchen says it's a Neandertal merkin. 

And that, my friends, is Google gold.
