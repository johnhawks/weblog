Eric Michael Johnson has posted a wonderful and wide-ranging interview with Sarah Blaffer Hrdy: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/primate-diaries/2012/03/16/raising-darwins-consciousness-sarah-blaffer-hrdy-on-the-evolutionary-lessons-of-motherhood/">"Raising Darwins Consciousness: Sarah Blaffer Hrdy on the Evolutionary Lessons of Motherhood"</a>. 

<blockquote> The balance of my life did not feel right. Furthermore, the state of my field was such that teaching in an anthropology department was not bringing me a whole lot of satisfaction. Its so hard to talk about it and tell the truth because there were so many different angles to it. But, basically, I wrote a book proposal, submitted it to publishers, there was an auction, the book was sold, and I immediately resigned from the university. I was offered to take the status of Professor Emerita, which I thought was an attractive offer. It didnt come with any pension or medical benefits but, because my work had been so controversial, it was a way for me to quit with dignity. So thats what I did. </blockquote>
