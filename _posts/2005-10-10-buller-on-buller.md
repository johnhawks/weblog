<p>
On the subject of objections to Buller's book, I should point out that Buller himself <a href="http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/research.shtml">has a website</a> where he has additional work and some responses to critics (particularly <a href="http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/ticsreply.pdf">this reply</a> to the short comments in TiCS).

Also on the subject, does anybody else think this debate is looking very much like the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/alligator_vs_python_2005.html">crocodile vs. python deathmatch</a> from last week?
