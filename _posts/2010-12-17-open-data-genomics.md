<i>Nature</i> this week carries a story by Ewen Callaway titled, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101215/full/468880a.html">"The rise of the genome bloggers"</a>. The main subject is <a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/">Dienekes Pontikos</a>, whose <a href="http://dodecad.blogspot.com/">"Dodecad Ancestry Project"</a> seeks to illuminate population structure in undersampled populations by using SNP data supplied by volunteers with results from commercial testing companies. 

I like this quote: 

<blockquote>But Pontikos sees little point in formally publishing his findings. "I can bypass them entirely, and have the entire world review what I write," he wrote in an e-mail. Indeed, comments on his blog  "could you please provide the eigenvalues for the principal component analysis", for instance  read like the niggling recommendations of a manuscript reviewer.</blockquote>

I've often found that the best reviews of my work come from blogs and readers, not from peer review itself. With a project like this, the most critical readings will come from the most interested community, which may be a broader public than the scientific community. 

The article also points to other worthwhile efforts such as <a href="http://bga101.blogspot.com/">Eurogenes</a> and <a href="http://www.genomesunzipped.org/">Genomes Unzipped</a>, which are beginning to make connections between academic and public research.
