In this lecture, the main theme is the concept of heritability. I use survey data from my class, both this semester and over several years, to examine stature in the students and their parents. I illustrate the idea of the normal distribution with stature data, and discuss the reasons why continuously measured traits often fit that distribution. Also, I define the idea of "regression to the mean" and discuss its relation to inheritance.

This is a continuing experiment in sharing the lectures for the course online. For my explainer, you can see <a href="http://johnhawks.net/courses/principles/spring-2012-lecture-2">Lecture 2: Feet</a>.
