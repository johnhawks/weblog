The TED conference has a number of independent affiliated events called TEDx. From the recent TEDxTbilisi, I'm happy to be able to share a 15-minute talk by David Lordkipanidze, titled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC0gdpVS4uM">"The first humans out of Africa"</a>. He discusses the importance of the Dmanisi site, which gives us such fascinating information about the origins of our genus.
