For anthropologists, Africa was a point of exceptional diversity between 2 million and 1.5 million years ago. In both East and South Africa, the fossil record presents evidence of several different hominin species. Some fossils belong to our own genus, <em>Homo</em>, and others belong to robust australopithecines. 

These two forms seem like they should be easy to tell apart. Robust australopithecines had extraordinarily large mandibles compared to living humans. Consider: 

<ul>
<li>The main part of the mandible, which holds the teeth, is called the <strong>mandibular corpus</strong>. In robust australopithecines, this is often extremely thick and tall, with a large distance from the inferior border of the mandible to the teeth.</li>

<li>The portion of the mandible that extends upward to articulate with the temporal bone is called the <strong>mandibular ramus</strong> -- with one on both left and right sides. The mandibular ramus of many robust australopithecines is exceedingly tall, reflecting the very vertically tall faces of these hominins. </li>

<li>Robust australopithecines have hugely expanded premolars and molars, and greatly reduced incisors and canines. Early <em>Homo</em> has overall larger teeth than in living humans, but the proportions between the molars, premolars, incisors and canines is very much like people today. </li>

</ul>

However, despite these obvious differences, the mandibles of early <em>Homo</em> and robust australopithecines are not always so easy to tell apart. This station has several mandibles from robust australopithecines, mainly from <em>Australopithecus robustus</em> from Swartkrans and Kromdraai, South Africa. There are also several mandibles of <em>Homo erectus</em> here, and a handful of mandibles that are likely early <em>Homo</em> but not definitely <em>H. erectus</em>. 

Can you tell them apart? Try seriating these from most humanlike to most robust australpithecine-like. Is there a clear dividing line between the two, or are there questionable specimens?
