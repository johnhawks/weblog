Lager beer comes from a hybrid cold-tolerant strain of yeast, one parent of which has been <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/202349/20110823/yeast-lager-beer-university-of-wisconsin-madison-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-stowaway-patagonia-alcohol.htm">unknown to science until now</a>: 

<blockquote>They found what turned out to be the missing piece an ocean away in the southern beech woodlands of Patagonia.

Researchers also identified genetic mutations in the lager yeast hybrid distinctive from the genome of the wild lager yeast. Those changes accumulated since those first immigrant yeasts melded with their ale cousins 500 years ago, and refined the lager yeast's ability to metabolize sugar and malt and to produce sulfites, transforming an organism that evolved on beech trees into a beer-making machine.</blockquote>

Hmm...genetic mixture, rapid selection...and <i>beer!</i> I knew I'd been missing something important in my work.
