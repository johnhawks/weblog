This is decidedly unsettling: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1622-4">"Windborne long-distance migration of malaria mosquitoes in the Sahel"</a>.

<blockquote>Studies seeking to understand the paradoxical persistence of malaria in areas in which surface water is absent for 3–8 months of the year have suggested that some species of <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito use long-distance migration. Here we confirm this hypothesis through aerial sampling of mosquitoes at 40–290 m above ground level and provide—to our knowledge—the first evidence of windborne migration of African malaria vectors, and consequently of the pathogens that they transmit. </blockquote>

The work is by Diana Huestis and coworkers in <em>Nature</em>. The long-distance dispersal helps to address why it is so hard to eliminate malaria. It looks like females (80% of those dispersing this way) take on blood meals and then hitch a ride on the wind.
