<em>Nautilus</em> is running a nice interview with Lee Berger about <em>Homo naledi</em> and other things: <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/30/identity/the-man-who-used-facebook-to-find-an-extinct-human-species">"The Man Who Used Facebook to Find an Extinct Human Species"</a>. 

From the interview:

<blockquote>We had senior anthropologists saying there was nothing left to find, we should stop teaching graduate students, you’re not going to find fossils in the soil anymore, they’re a declining resource. The richest fossil hominin site on the continent of Africa was less than a mile from the most explored locality on the continent. What does that tell you? That there must be extraordinary findings still.</blockquote>

Many interesting points in the interview about how paleoanthropology has been changing into a team-oriented science.
