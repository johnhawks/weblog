Anthropologist Hugh Gusterson <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/What-if-They-Had-a-Science-War/125828/">writes about the #AAAfail controversy in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></a>, from his perspective as one of the board members who purged science from the long-range plan. Gusterson disclaims any role in actually writing the revised statement, but curiously elides any details about the content of the board's "brief" discussion. 

The wordy essay paints concerned scientists as clueless kerfufflers intent on damaging the association but succeeding only in shooting themselves in the foot. 

Shorter Hugh Gusterson: "Shut up, scientists!"
