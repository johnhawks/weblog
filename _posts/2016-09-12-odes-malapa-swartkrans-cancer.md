A nice piece in <em>The Conversation</em> by Edward Odes and Patrick Randolph-Quinney describing their research into the tumors afflicting ancient specimens from Swartkrans and Malapa: <a href="https://theconversation.com/fossil-evidence-reveals-that-cancer-in-humans-goes-back-1-7-million-years-63430">"Fossil evidence reveals that cancer in humans goes back 1.7 million years"</a>. 

<blockquote>Tumours and cancers are collectively known as neoplastic diseases. Until now, the oldest evidence of neoplasia in the hominin fossil record dated back 120,000 years. This was found in a rib fragment of a Neanderthal from Krapina in Croatia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But our discovery, in two South African cave sites, offers definitive evidence of cancer in hominins – human ancestors – as far back as 1.7 million years ago.</blockquote>
