Today's sketchbook:

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/sangiran_17_eyes_watercolor_2009.jpg" width="400" height="208" alt="Eyes of a hominid" />
</div>

I regard this one as unfinished, but I very much like the way the eyes have turned out, so I cropped it. Watercolors and gouache on an Academie pad.
