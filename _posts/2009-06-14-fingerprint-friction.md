I ran across this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8093134.stm">BBC story about a fingerprint friction experiment</a> (via <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/06/14/0140204/Scientists-Wonder-What-Fingerprints-Are-For">Slashdot</a>). 

<blockquote>Scientists say they have disproved the theory that fingerprints improve grip by increasing friction between people's hands and the surface they are holding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>[I]n a series of tests to measure friction between a finger and a piece of acrylic glass, it was debunked by a University of Manchester team.</blockquote>

That's well and good, <b>assuming that Paleocene trees were covered with acrylic glass</b>. 

<blockquote>Instead, Dr Ennos believes that fingerprints may have evolved to help us grip on to rough surfaces...</blockquote>

Oh, well then. Like, say, Paleocene trees. If you're interested in the evolution of fingerprints, you may be surprised to find out that koalas have a remarkable parallelism with primates in their fingerprint form -- <a href="http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-04/ns_hll.html">a 1997 paper by Maciej Henneberg</a> describes them.
