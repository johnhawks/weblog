Edmund Blair Bolles has posted some entries about the proceedings at a protolanguage conference. There's much of interest there, but I'll give a provocative quote from <a href="http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2009/09/protolanguage-after-torun.html">his summation</a>: 

<blockquote>It seems to me that the work of the protolanguage concept may be done and it is time to put the term aside. It was useful for hammering the big-bang theory of language leaping full-blown from the head of some recent <i>Homo sapiens</i>, but now protolanguage is beginning to look a bit anti-evolutionary itself. Prototypes are early versions that set the standards for later ones, but the concept of a type is Platonic rather than Darwinian. Protolanguages were not early versions of what weve got today, they were their own thing, evolved to serve the purposes of their day. </blockquote>

Earlier in the week, he also posted on <a href="http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2009/09/protolanguage-was-symbolic.html">a presentation by Terrence Deacon</a> and <a href="http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2009/09/a-protolinguistic-fossil.html">a cool presentation on "protolinguistic fossils" by Ljiljana Progovac</a>, which seemed to give a different view of the concept from the essentially pidgin language hypothesis of Derek Bickerton. 

UPDATE (2009-09-29): Derek Bickerton wrote to take issue with my last sentence; in his opinion the talks cited here describe a protolanguage bounded by the same essential conditions as his own ideas. I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/mailbag/bickerton-protolanguage-letter-2009.html">post Bickerton's record in full</a> in the mailbag and a few additional words of reply.
