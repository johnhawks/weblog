Daniel MacArthur is reporting on today's big showdown between Congress and genomics testing companies: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/a_sad_day_for_personal_genomic.php">"A sad day for personal genomics."</a>

Several companies got hit with a sting by the Government Accounting Office, MacArthur has the audio with captions. My favorite is the agent who was posing as a girl trying to "surprise" her fianc&eacute;' with a DNA test. A company rep who said they had ways to "pretty much repair DNA damage" is a snake who should be stomped on. 

<blockquote>There's no denying it: that tape is pure gold for the critics of the DTC testing industry. In the first and third clips, a couple of poorly-trained call centre operators at otherwise reputable companies nonchalantly produce the stake that will now be driven into the heart of the DTC industry, over and over again.</blockquote>

Genotyping is cheap nowadays, but not cheap enough. Crooks see easy marks willing to shovel out $400 at a time; more honest companies can't turn away too many $400 prospects or else their IPO may tank. Call center employees work with a script, and somebody writes the script and tells them when it's OK to improvise. 

UPDATE (2010-07-23): More from Dan Vorhaus: <a href="http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2010/07/22/from-gulf-oil-to-snake-oil-congress-takes-aim-at-dtc-genetic-testing/">"From Gulf Oil to Snake Oil: Congress Takes Aim at DTC Genetic Testing."</a> Also, a response from genomics tester 23andMe: <a href="http://spittoon.23andme.com/2010/07/23/gao-studies-science-non-scientifically/">"GAO Studies Science Non-Scientifically."</a> Maybe it's a "war on science"...
