My first Rising Star Expedition update has been posted on the expedition blog: <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/15/in-the-hot-seat/">"In the hot seat"</a>. 

<blockquote>Ive had an extraordinary number of new fossils pass through my hands in the last four days. But heres what finally brought me to tears: Our young scientists and cavers running up to the command center, cranking up the generator, so they could do a spontaneous Skype call to a third grade class in Rhode Island.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Keep watching.</blockquote>

The post has already gotten some attention, and if you're looking for a good news story on yesterday's events at the site, I recommend this one from Alan Boyle: <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/science/cave-women-unearth-skull-unknown-human-ancestor-2D11603661">"Cave women unearth skull of unknown human ancestor"</a>. Yes, the headline is awful for these young scientists, but the story really gives a good overview of what is going on. 

But of course the best source is <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/">the Rising Star Expedition blog</a>, and the Twitter updates from @johnhawks and @LeeRBerger.
