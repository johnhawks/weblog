I just got the first round of statistics on students enrolled in my upcoming MOOC, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/humanevolution">Human Evolution Past and Future</a>. These date to a few months ago, so don't include all the 17,000+ students now signed up for the course, but we've been trying hard to get these numbers because international reach is one of the really key aspects of these massive courses. 



Here are the top twenty countries represented by numbers. The US has around three times the numbers of Brazil, but the long tail stretches out to more than 100 countries with small steps between the others.

I have to say, this is such an inspiring list to me! According to the Coursera stats, 58% of enrollees are native English speakers, and educational levels are widely scattered, with 40% having at least some postbaccalaureate education, 30% with a bachelor's degree, 17% some college, and 10% having less than a high school degree. Students are coming from every age group, with a quarter of the students under 26 years old, and nearly a quarter over 55 years old. And 53% of my students report themselves as female -- which contrasts with the heavily male-biased enrollment of many MOOCs. 



I can definitely say that this course will have something for all these students at every level. I've just returned from summer fieldwork and filming, and I'll be reporting on some of the really exciting opportunities that my friends and colleagues have made available for the MOOC participants.
