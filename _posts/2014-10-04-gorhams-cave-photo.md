Gorham's Cave is on the eastern face of Gibraltar. It was carved by the sea, and now lies above sea level because of the upthrust of the Rock over hundreds of thousands of years.

I took this photo from a boat offshore, and the one thing it lacks is a convenient scale. The cave entrance soars more than forty meters high.
