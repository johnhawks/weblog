This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/science/08monkey.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">story about monkey communication</a> is worth a pointer: 

<blockquote>Having spent months recording the monkeys calls in response to both natural and artificial stimuli, a group led by Klaus Zuberbhler of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland argues that the Campbells monkeys have a primitive form of syntax.

This is likely to be a controversial claim because despite extensive efforts to teach chimpanzees language, the subjects showed little or no ability to combine the sounds they learned into a sentence with a larger meaning. Syntax, basic to the structure of language, seemed be a uniquely human faculty.</blockquote>

I can't tell from the linked story how strong the evidence is, although there are interesting illustrations.
