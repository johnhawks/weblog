The <i>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</i> <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=786243">prints a nice article about the work of my UW colleague, Jenny Boughman</a>. Boughman studies adaptation and mating behavior in sticklebacks -- a model species for much current research on speciation. 

<blockquote>Either form of cuckoldry undermines female choice, she said, and works against females central role in controlling reproduction in the species. It can also undermine the entire speciation process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The female had selected a male to mate with, but in fact the father of her offspring was not the male that she picked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although the thieving and sneaking Boughman saw was between males of the same species, if habitat conditions change, it could just as easily happen between species, she noted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All her research is pointing to one overall conclusion: the speciation process is much more fragile than scientists had once thought.</bloockquote>
