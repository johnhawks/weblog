Razib's <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/02/10-questions-for-peter-turchin.php">"10 questions for Peter Turchin"</a>, population dynamist and historical theoretician, is well worth reading. 

A short excerpt: 

<blockquote>The main defensive mechanism is to ignore us, which is what 95% of historians do. That's fine with me. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the positive reception of these ideas among historical social scientists and the (estimated) 5% of historians. It suggests to me that the time of cliodynamics has come. Incidentally, we are launching a peer-reviewed journal this year.</blockquote>
