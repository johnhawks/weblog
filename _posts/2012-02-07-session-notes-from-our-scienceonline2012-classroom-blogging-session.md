Andrea Novicki has published some of her notes on the session that I organized with Jason Goldman at ScienceOnline2012: <a href="http://cit.duke.edu/blog/2012/01/blogging-in-the-undergraduate-science-classroom/">"Blogging in the undergraduate classroom"</a>. I'll write up my own notes when I have some spare time, as it was a great session with many good experiences shared by the group of attendees.
