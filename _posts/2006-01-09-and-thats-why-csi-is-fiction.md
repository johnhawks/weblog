From <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10771052/">the AP story "Mozart mystery just gets murkier"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>After months of sophisticated DNA sleuthing reminiscent of a "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" episode, forensics experts admitted Sunday on national television that they still can't say with certainty whether an ancient skull belonged to the composer, as some believe.</blockquote>

<p>
They tried to compare the mtDNA of the skull with two maternal relatives from the "Mozart family grave" in Salzburg. But the maternal relatives didn't have the same mtDNA sequence!
</p>

<blockquote>Experts had assumed the remains were of Mozart's maternal grandmother and a niece. But DNA analysis showed that none of the skeletons in the grave were related, making it impossible to prove that the skull was Mozart's, Parson said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The dead took their secrets to the grave," the documentary concluded.</blockquote>

<p>
Or someone else's, evidently.
