<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham">Daniel H. Burnham</a>, Chicago architect and city planner (1846-1912): 

<blockquote>Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence. Remember that our sons and our grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.</blockquote>
