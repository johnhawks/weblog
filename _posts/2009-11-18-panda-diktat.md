I haven't been blogging quite as often, but <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34015206/ns/technology_and_science-science/">you can see I've been busy with other business:</a>

<blockquote>VIENNA - A 2-year-old panda who charmed his way into the hearts of Austrians is headed to China.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fu Long has been the star attraction at Vienna's Schoenbrunn Zoo since he was born there on Aug. 23, 2007.</blockquote>

Yes, now I can make my appearance there as scheduled.
