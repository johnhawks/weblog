Agust√≠n Fuentes has a short essay in <em>New York</em> magazine's "Science of Us": <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/03/how-imagination-makes-us-human.html">"Creative Collaboration Is What Humans Do Best."</a>

<blockquote>But in order to best deploy this capacity we need to remove the set of blinders most of us wear. Many humans have become convinced that we are individually powerless, and have forgotten what creativity is and how its spark resides in all of us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Creativity is not a private endeavor vested in a single person or a select group of people. It is not solely about genius in the arts or sciences, or actions by prominent artists, celebrities, or politicians. It is not even limited to the work of particularly original thinkers. Creativity emerges from the interconnections of ideas, experiences, and imagination.</blockquote>

Fuentes' new book is called <a href="http://amzn.to/2ncysZH"><em>The Creative Spark: How Imagination Made Humans Exceptional</em></a>.
