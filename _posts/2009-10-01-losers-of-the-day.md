Now that <i>Ardipithecus</i> has descended from heaven to join us mortals, who is grumbling the worst?

<ul>
<li><b><i>Nature</i></b>. After a long run of Middle Awash articles through the 1990's and 2000's, what did they do to lose this one?  

<li><b>Touma&iuml;</b>. If Ardi had a primitive apelike postcranium, how bipedal could this 7-million-year-old fossil have been?

<li><b>Morphometricians</b>. Lovejoy accuses them of ignoring both "careful comparative anatomy" and evo-devo. That's bound to leave a mark.

<li><b>Chimpanzees</b>. OK, the chimps don't care -- but they're looking more and more irrelevant to interpreting early hominins. 

<li><b>Anybody else working on early hominin locomotion</b>. Back to the drawing board. 

</ul>
