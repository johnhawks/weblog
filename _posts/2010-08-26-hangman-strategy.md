You may have seen that story about "jazz" being the hardest Hangman word. Personally, I always figure that such a short word is hardly fair, but I'm not that good at Hangman. The <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/">inside story of how they figured out</a> the hardest words is kind of interesting -- it involves a guy writing a Mathematica Demonstration to play Hangman and his daughter getting annoyed at never being able to beat the computer and its dictionary.
