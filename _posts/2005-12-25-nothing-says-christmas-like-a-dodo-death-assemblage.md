I'm sure you've seen <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4556928.stm">the story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>A team of Dutch and Mauritian scientists discovered the bones in a swampy area near a sugar plantation on the south-east of the island.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The bones were said to have been recovered from a single layer of earth, with the prospect of further excavations to come.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sections of beaks and the remains of dodo chicks were thought to be among the find.</blockquote>

<p>
What more can I say? Oh, yeah: now begins the dodo genome project.
