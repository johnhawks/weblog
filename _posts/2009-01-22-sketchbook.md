Today's sketchbook page: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/lon_chaney_west_of_zanzibar_sketchbook.jpg" width="400" height="363" alt="Drawing of Lon Chaney" />
</div>

Something a little different today. This is Lon Chaney, in a still from <i>West of Zanzibar</i>. Many reasons: 

1. "The man of a thousand faces" is perfect for studies of facial expressions.

2. I needed a break from ink.

3. Like me, he's a <strike>Kansan</strike>. (Criminy, he's from Colorado Springs!)

4. He has my haircut.
