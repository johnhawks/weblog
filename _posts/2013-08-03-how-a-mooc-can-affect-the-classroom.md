Duke University evolutionary biologist Mohamed Noor reflects on the way that teaching a MOOC has changed his classroom teaching: <a href="http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/article/the-classroom-experience-reimagined">"The classroom experience reimagined"</a>. Noor began teaching a MOOC with Coursera last year: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/geneticsevolution">"Introduction to Genetics and Evolution"</a>, in conjunction with a regular course he teaches to 400 undergraduates at Duke.



<blockquote>My tentative conclusion is that its worth it. The types of questions I get now are (almost) never about repeating something I just said, but more about placing the material into a broader context or tying it to other topics. I perceive much more higher-level thinking about the material, and I am able to have students grasp concepts with which I recall struggling even as a graduate student. The performance on most of the assessments has gone up. As one (slightly grouchy) student put it: Of course were doing better. Youre making us work more on the same material.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From this point, I'll feel that I'm cheating my students if I give a class that is purely passive and lecture-based. If all I did was lecture, then I would be delivering little or no more value to these students than what they could obtain from something to which they have easy accessthe evergrowing number of MOOCs.</blockquote>



My experience filming segments for my MOOC has been amazing so far, and I have to say the resulting videos are way better than a classroom lecture. With a classroom lecture I can't possibly recreate the experience of being in the field, talking to experts about their work <em>as they are doing it</em>. 



Professors are used to a role in which, in the classroom, they are the local experts on everything that they teach. Technology now makes it possible for a professor to be a local guide to global experts. I think that is a really positive change from the students' perspective, but it is a different role than most professors have been playing.
