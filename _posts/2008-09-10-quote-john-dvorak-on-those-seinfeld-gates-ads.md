<blockquote>Scenario: Two guys meet in a shoe store. The one guys offers a churro to the otheran obvious phallic symbol, possibly a code word. The guy refuses. So the guy with the churro starts to massage the other guy's foot, and asks about what he's feeling. The guy who relented at first says a definite code word: "leather." The two look furtively at each other for an uncomfortably long time. They scene is just short of a wink taking place. One mentions "showering" with clothes on. The next thing you know the twosome, now each holding rigid churros, walk off together. One asks the other to adjust his underwear as a "sign."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now if this isn't some sadomasochistic, kinky pickup scene then what's the point? </blockquote>
