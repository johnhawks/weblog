On the topic of the archaeology of South Asia, I want to point readers to <a href="http://sheilamishra.wordpress.com/">Sheila Mishra's blog</a>. She has picked up a number of topics of recent interest, including the <a href="http://sheilamishra.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/march-2011-epoch-making-month-for-indian-palaeolithic-studiesthe-oldest-and-the-youngest-acheulian-in-the-world/">earlier Acheulean dates by Pappu and colleagues</a>, the <a href="http://sheilamishra.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/indian-stone-age-sequence-question-11comparing-indian-stone-age-sequence-with-europe-africa-se-asia-and-china/">comparison of terminology for Stone Age sites in India versus other regions</a> and the issue of continuity between Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic within South Asia</a>. It's a brief and nicely-referenced source of information and I look forward to seeing more.
