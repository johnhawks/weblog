Razib: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2010/03/oca2_makes_east_asians_white_a.php">"OCA2 makes East Asians white and Europeans blue."</a>He discusses a study out of Esteban Parra's lab in <i>PLoS Genetics</i> (open access), which characterizes a non-synonymous polymorphism in China that lies on a recently selected haplotype. The genotypes correlate additively with skin melanin -- a very different effect from the European new mutant allele.
