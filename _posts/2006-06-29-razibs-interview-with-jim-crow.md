<p>
Now I'm back home again, and catching up on some reading. So I direct your attention to <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/10-questions-for-jim-crow.php">this excellent interview</a> with Jim Crow, from Razib's 10 questions series. It touches on the history of population genetics -- in which Crow himself played an important part -- as well as some of the hot-button issues of the present.
