From the preface of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7058/pg7058.html"><em>Mankind in the Making</em></a>, by H. G. Wells: 

<blockquote>It is a work that the writer admits he has undertaken primarily for his own mental comfort. He is remarkably not qualified to assume an authoritative tone in these matters, and he is acutely aware of the many defects in detailed knowledge, in temper, and in training these papers collectively display. He is aware that at such points, for example, as the reference to authorities in the chapter on the biological problem, and to books in the educational chapter, the lacunar quality of his reading and knowledge is only too evident; to fill in and complete his designnotably in the fourth paperhe has had quite frankly to jerry-build here and there. Nevertheless, he ventures to publish this book. </blockquote>
