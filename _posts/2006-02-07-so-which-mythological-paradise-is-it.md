You've probably seen <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11114156/">the story about the Foja Mountains in Papua New Guinea</a>. Here are a couple of paragraphs: 
</p>

<blockquote>JAKARTA, Indonesia - Describing it as the discovery of a "Lost World," conservation groups and Indonesia on Tuesday said an expedition to one of Asia's most isolated jungles had found several dozen new species of frogs, butterflies, flowers and birds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It's as close to the Garden of Eden as you're going to find on Earth," Bruce Beehler, a Conservation International scientist who led the expedition, said in a statement.</blockquote>

<p>
OK, so is it the "Lost World" or the "Garden of Eden"? Let's get this straight. 
</p>

<p>
I say, it's the Garden of Eden if it has unicorns, and the Lost World if it has dinosaurs. Gretchen says it depends how bloodthirsty the animals are.
