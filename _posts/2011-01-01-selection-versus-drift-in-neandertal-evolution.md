My graduate student Marc Kissel and I are putting on a poster today at the AAPA meetings. Marc has prepared a nice PDF of the poster and we're putting it here for people to have access after and beyond the meeting. Thanks to the magic of QR codes, we're able to direct people to this page from the poster itself, so welcome!

It's scaled giantly at the moment and I'll work on finding a way to decrease the zoom level. But it will download and display fine on any PDF viewer. Enjoy!
