Last year, the show had several <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/tv/numb3rs_lahn_2006.html">anthro-related</a> <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/tv/numbers_kennewick_2005.html">episodes</a>, but this year it has been mostly network theory and the like. Until last night, when <i>Sewall Wright was mentioned by name!</i>

<p>
That's right, folks. US network drama. Friday night. Sewall Wright. 
</p>

<p>
Sweeeeeeeet!
</p>

<p>
Why Sewall Wright? Well, our intrepid mathematician, Charlie, had to calculate the inbreeding coefficient for a monomaniacal polygamist cult leader. His pedigree for five generations or so was sewn into a quilt, and neither Charlie nor his attractive mathematician girlfriend knew what the symbols represented -- until Charlie's department chair, <b>played by Kathy Najimy, for goodness sake</b>, (who happened to be in Charlie's house because she is <b>getting it on with Charlie's dad</b> -- you know, Judd Hirsch -- recognized the pedigree symbols from <i>cattle breeding!</i>
</p>

<p>
Is this a great show, or what?  
</p>

<p>
Of course, they followed that moment with some genetic nonsense about how the cult leader couldn't conceive with any of his highly related wives, so he had to have a particular unrelated female to mate with. I say, "nonsense," mainly because it was irrelevant to the plot, and didn't really convey a correct understanding of "recessive" alleles.

<p>
But how much can I ask for, really? Especially when <b>I happened to be reading Sewall Wright at that very moment!</b>
