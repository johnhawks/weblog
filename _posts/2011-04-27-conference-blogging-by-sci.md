Scicurious has written a very nice howto giving concrete advice about blogging a conference: <a href="http://scienceofblogging.com/guest-post-how-to-blog-a-conference/">"How To Blog a Conference"</a>. Lots and lots of good ideas and advice in her post. I admire anyone with the discipline to take notes and do interviews at a conference. It's all I can do to keep up with the schmoozing. 

But I would say that the process Sci followed is an excellent strategy for networking and training yourself as an effective communicator of your own science.
