<em>Nautilus</em> interviewed archaeologist Meg Conkey about her work, including the "Between the Caves" survey project in France, to establish the pattern of open-air occupation sites in regions mostly known for the ancient remains in caves: <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/8/home/the-cavemans-home-was-not-a-cave">"The caveman's home was not a cave"</a>. 

She describes the systematic survey of plowed fields in search of flint artifacts, and notes the rarity of discovery of actual occupation sites: 

<blockquote>Then we discovered what we think is an open-air habitation site in Peyre Blanque, also in the Ariège region, on a ridge that’s never been plowed. We found artifacts eroding out of a muddy horseback-riding trail in the woods. The horses had stirred up the mud, and exposed some stone tools; now the site has yielded hundreds of them. We started excavating and found stone slabs, which we believe is a habitation structure in the open-air, probably from the Upper Paleolithic, about 17,000 years ago. We also found yellow, black, and red pigments, meaning ochre—powdered hydrated iron oxide—that early humans used for art and body art.</blockquote>

The interview gives some interesting perspective on what Paleolithic archaeologists mean when they use the term, "home", and how discoveries in caves have biased our intuition about the ancient landscape.
