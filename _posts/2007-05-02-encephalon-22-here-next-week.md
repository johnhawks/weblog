Next Monday (May 7) I'll be hosting a blog carnival, Encephalon, devoted to neuroscience. If you have posts that relate to the topic, just let me know (jh<!-- here is some random text -->awks<!-- Oops, there's some more random text -->@<!-- Hmm... I guess usually random text says lorem ipsum or something like that -->wisc<!-- Oh, heck! -->.edu) and I'll include a link and short teaser.

If you want to know what this is all about, you can find the last Encephalon <a href="http://ouroboros.wordpress.com/2007/04/23/encephalon-21-a-neuroscience-blog-carnival/">at Ouroboros</a>.

You don't have to be an expert, and diverse takes on the current neuroscience scene are appreciated!
