L'Abb&eacute; Henri Breuil is pictured, center with the cane. This photo is from <i>Men of the Old Stone Age</i>, by Henry Fairfield Osborn, publication date 1915. L'Abb&eacute; Breuil, known as the first archaeological expert of Paleolithic art, was one of a number of scientists who hosted Osborn on a tour of southern France and Cantabria. The book draws heavily on Osborn's exposure to the record in this area.
