Clive Finlayson has started a new blog featuring some of the day-to-day story of ongoing fieldwork at Gorham's and Vanguard Caves, Gibraltar: <a href="http://clivehumanevo.blogspot.com/2013/06/i-have-decided-to-start-this-blog-so-as.html">"Clive Finlayson's Human Evolution Blog"</a>. 

The first installment has a rich array of photos showing the logistics of getting material in and out of the sites. The caves are just above sea level, but only accessible by land via a very high climb, so some materials are brought to the site by boat. Also Geraldine Finlayson and Darren Fa are involved in some underwater exploration off the coast. These are incredible archaeological sites and I hope to visit there again soon!
