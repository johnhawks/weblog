Adrian Smith is a biologist and researcher on ants, who has written an account of his newfound skills for sharing his research highlights on video: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04606-2">"YouTube your science"</a>.

He tells the story of sitting with his mom in a video studio, an experience which helped him realize how much his science was removed from the language that ordinary non-scientists can understand.


<blockquote>First-person accounts of science were not a part of my life when I was younger. I am a first-generation university graduate with no immediate or extended family members who are involved in scientific careers. As a child, Iâ€™d never known a working scientist. When I was filming that video with my mum, I realized that I was presenting myself as a professional scientist to a family member who also had never had a personal connection to science before me. Making videos and using press releases to distribute them has helped me to introduce myself and my colleagues to the world as scientists. I now view the impact of my research not just in relation to the metrics around my journal articles, but also in terms of how well I can make my work available to those outside my profession.</blockquote>

This is such an important moment in the history of science, and we need many more scientists to heighten the engagement of the public in our work.
