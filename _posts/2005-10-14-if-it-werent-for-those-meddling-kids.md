What accounts for the coincidence of <i>Science</i> publishing the <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/weber_microcephaly_comment_2005.html">LB1 microcephaly exchange</a> in the same week that <i>Nature</i> published <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/flores_update_oct_2005.html">the new Liang Bua bones</a>? I can think of three hypotheses: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>The journals simply arranged it long in advance. This would comport with their treatment of the chimpanzee genome announcement, which occurred in <i>Nature</i> but had coordinating papers in <i>Science</i> in the same week.</li>
<li><i>Science</i> found out about the <i>Nature</i> paper and moved up its commentary to take advantage of the press coverage. This would be relatively easy since the technical comment takes up so little journal space. </li>
<li><i>Nature</i> found out about the microcephaly exchange and moved up publication of the long-delayed (6 month review) bone paper to <i>beat</i> the press. </li>
</ol>

<p>
The result of the timing is pretty clear: <i>Nature</i> got a head start on saturating the press, which put out stories on the new bones starting on Tuesday. The first article mentioning the <i>Science</i> exchange appeared on Thursday, and the story has not been widely picked up. Outcome: the vast majority of press accounts emphasize the additional evidence for small body size, but don't include the strongest evidence for pathology published to date. 
</p>

<p>
This outcome doesn't, of course, necessarily favor any of the above hypotheses, especially since a technical comment cannot expect to get the kind of attention of a regular research paper. And <i>Nature</i> always comes out a day before <i>Science</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But Tuesday is not a day before Thursday: it's <i>two</i> days. The stories started on Tuesday because somebody broke the <i>Nature</i> press embargo. According to Google News, the first stories to break on Tuesday were from Reuters and from <i>Nature's</i> own online news site. 
</p>

<p>
So who did it?
