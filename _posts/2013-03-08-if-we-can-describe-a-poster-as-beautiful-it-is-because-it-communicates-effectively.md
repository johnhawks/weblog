Zen Faulkes, on why beautiful, well-made scientific poster presentations are not just an exercise in catching attention for oneself: <a href="http://betterposters.blogspot.com/2013/03/more-than-marketing.html">"More than marketing"</a>.

<blockquote>I also had a little lesprit de lescalier on what a well-designed poster says about its creator. It shows that you understand what is important. A poster almost always demands you leave stuff out, which means you have to make decisions about what to include, exclude, and emphasize. Thus, you can only arrive at a beautiful, well-made poster if you have a deep understanding of the research you are presenting on it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A well-made poster shows mastery of the material, not just tricks to grab attention.</blockquote>

It's that time of year again, when people are designing poster presentations for the AAPA meetings. If you haven't before, check out Zen's <a href="http://betterposters.blogspot.com">"Better Posters" site.</a>
