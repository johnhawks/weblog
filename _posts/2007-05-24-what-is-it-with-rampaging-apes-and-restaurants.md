Is there a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/first-a-croc-attack-now-orangutan-goes-wild-in-taiwan-zoo/2007/05/24/1179601579656.html">subtle hidden plan</a>?
</p>

<blockquote>The incident at the Shaoshan Zoo in Kaohsiung began on Wednesday when the orang-utan pushed his way out of his cage and wandered into a nearby restaurant courtyard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As zoo officials scurried to bring the animal under control, he overturned picnic tables and motorcycles, forcing diners to cower inside the eatery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally an official shot the orang-utan in the upper body with a stun gun, and he was taken away in the scoop of a small bulldozer.</blockquote>

<p>
The orangutan joins last week's <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/top-of-the-charts-for-escaped-gorilla/">berzerk Rotterdam gorilla</a>, Bokito: 
</p>

<blockquote>A group of people tried to barricade themselves inside a restaurant on the zoo grounds, only to watch in horror as the gorilla, its mouth "covered in blood," bashed his way in through a glass door, according to BBC News.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That was where he was recaptured, though, when a zookeeper managed to sink a tranquilizer needle into him. </blockquote>

<p>
Is it just me, or do you get the feeling that <b>the smell of fried food</b> is the only thing standing between us and <b>world ape domination?</b>

<p>
Or maybe the zoos actually keep tranquilizer darts <b>in</b> the restaurants, <b>to subdue customers angry at the outrageous zoo food prices</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Evidently, Bokito has become <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/top-of-the-charts-for-escaped-gorilla/">a YouTube phenom</a>.
</p>

<p>
And Reuters tells us that a Dutch entrepreneur has registered to use the rampaging gorilla's name, Bokito, as a brand name for entertainment products: 
</p>

<blockquote>The name Bokito has been registered as a brand for DVDs, CDs, magazines, clothing and promotional services, the Dutch trademark office said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The owner of the Bokito brand will hope to mirror the success of polar bear cub "Knut" at Berlin's zoo. Knut was registered by the zoo as a brand, and he now has a website and a book deal.</blockquote>

<p>
For those of us who have always hoped that annoying pre-teen boys will get their comeuppance, Frans de Waal has tried to <a href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2007/05/aftershocks_of_gorilla_attack.php">throw water on the fire</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>The Volkskrant quotes gorilla expert Frans de Waal who says Bokito's victim is very luck to be alive. His action was a warning to visitors and zoo keepers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Don't try to attract attention, don't try to provoke wild animals,' he says. 'A zoo is not some fun event with real interaction with predators and primates.'</blockquote>

<p>
No, I guess not: 
</p>

<blockquote>"Everyone was in panic, running away, screaming, wailing, screaming kids running around. It was a total drama," one witness told NOS radio.</blockquote>
