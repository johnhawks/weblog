I liked the short article by sci-fi author John Scalzi, <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2009/05/scifi-blockbusters-before-star-wars.php">"Scifi movies made money before <i>Star Wars</i>, too"</a>: 

<blockquote>[A]djusting for inflation, Frankenstein raked in the equivalent of close to $375 million, which is a hit of historic proportions. No wonder Universal then cranked out a whole bunch of other monster movies in rapid succession.</blockquote>
