It's cute, it hugs its own little toy, and it's brought to you by WowWee, the same nice people who built <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/chimpanzeetronics_2005_christmas.html">the "Alive" Chimpanzee</a>. It's beginning to smell like Christmas, and that means it's time for <i>Robopanda!</i>

<p>
Uhh...oops...wrong file there...
</p>

<p>
Ah. Here we go:

Oh, this is a happy little fellow, isn't he? The closer these robot creatures get to that creeped-out teddy bear from <i>AI</i>, the more menacing. And aren't the glowing blue eyes an interesting design choice?

The Engadget techmavens <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/10/hands-on-with-wowwees-robopanda-even-grown-men-like-bear-hugs/">got to play with Robopanda</a> earlier this year.
</p>

<blockquote>Sure we may come across as rugged and ultra-suave, but deep down we're really big softies, which is why WowWee's new Robopanda is such a refreshing change from the vicious reptiles and flamethrowing humanoids that the company's usually pushing out the door.</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, if you only knew...
</p>

<blockquote>Featuring several touch sensitive areas as well as an accelerometer to measure speed (move too fast and it freaks out just a bit), RoboPanda offers numerous methods of interaction. </blockquote>

<p>
Whaaa?
</p>

<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2155503,00.asp">Lance Ulanoff's review</a> in <i>PC Magazine</i> mentions this unsettling tidbit: 
</p>

<blockquote>Like a small child, it issues a steady stream of requests, comments, and silly stories and ideas. At one point it asked me if I had ever been attacked by a panda, adding, "Do you want to be? AARRGH! Just kidding." This is "play" in the Robopanda's world.</blockquote>

<p>
Yesssss....like the way that wolf pups "play" in all those cute nature videos...
</p>

<blockquote>The 6-year-old sat rooted in front of the Robopanda, responding to every request and often answering verbally, though the robot cannot actually respond to anything anyone says. After a while I had to ask the little girl to leave, and she reluctantly agreed to stop playing with the Robopanda.</blockquote>

Like crack, this one is.
