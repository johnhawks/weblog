Holly Dunsworth comments on an NPR report on personal genomics: <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2012/10/be-afraid-of-fear-not-personal-genomics.html">"Be afraid of fear, not personal genomics"</a>. 

<blockquote>And the same fear that I'm trying to mitigate through education is the same fear that some journalists and ethicists seem to be perpetuating if not creating.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In my experience, if you're informed, you're likely to appreciate biological complexity rather than cling to genetic determinism. If you're informed, you understand the positive and negative consequences and aspects of personal genomics. If you're informed, you don't get lured into personal genomics for all the wrong reasons. </blockquote>

My favorite part of the post is her comment where she notes that the NPR piece devotes more space to describing the movie GATTACA than it does to the actual science. Here's a hint: When your <em>fictional analogy</em> takes more words than <em>reality</em>, you're doing it wrong.
