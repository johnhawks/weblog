I have a lot to say about the new study of African genomes by Joseph Lachance and colleagues <bib>Lachance:2012</bib>, which I think is tremendously exciting, along with the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5552">new preprint from Joseph Pickrell and colleagues on the arXiv</a>, which includes some similar analyses with SNP data. But I'm on my way to Africa myself today for a week, and don't have time to post all my thoughts about the new papers until I arrive there. So I'll try to post these over the weekend.
