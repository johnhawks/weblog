John Wilkins has started a "Scientist's Operating Manual" -- a collaborative project with the aim of writing a short text for non-scientists. I'm pointing to the <a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/09/30/scientists-operating-manual-introduction/">introductory post</a>, mainly because I really like the Feyerabend quote he uses, from <i>Against Method</i>: 

<blockquote>The idea that science can, and should, be run according to fixed and universal rules, is both unrealistic and pernicious. It is <i>unrealistic</i>, for it takes too simple a view of the talents of man and of the circumstances which encourage, or cause, their development. And it is <i>pernicious</i>, for the attempt to enforce the rules is bound to increase our professional qualifications at the expense of our humanity. In addition, the idea is <i>detrimental to science</i>, for it neglects the complex physical and historical conditions which influence scientific change. It makes our science less adaptable and more dogmatic: every methodological rule is associated with cosmological assumptions, so that using the rule we take it for granted that the assumptions are correct. </blockquote>

The "pernicious" part especially resonates. Rule-enforcing behavior makes the world safer for the entrenched. It is more notable at the granting level than the publication level.
