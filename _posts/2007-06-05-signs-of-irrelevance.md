From the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/sports/05araton.html"><i>NY Times</i> sports section</a>:

<blockquote><b>Old N.B.A. Try Is Becoming Cautionary Tale</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Maybe Rick Pitino shared with Billy Donovan what he best remembers about his last N.B.A. coaching experience, when the grass in Boston looked so much greener than Kentucky's but life with the Celtics left him feeling a discredited shade of blue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Maybe in a reported telephone conversation between mentor and disciple Pitino reminded Donovan of how some of the same players who jumped to his every frenzied college command <b>tuned him out as if he were an anthropology professor</b> when they were reunited in the pros.</blockquote>

Ooooh, that stung!
