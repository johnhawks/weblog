Today's sketchbook

Kenneth Branagh is appearing on <i>Mystery</i> this month in the British production of "Wallander." I love the way they light him throughout the whole thing -- they balance natural light on one side with artificial on the other, leaving a darkness etching across his face. I suppose they're going for that Ibsen quality for this Swedish detective. 

So I had to draw him, although it took a while to find a screenshot. The likeness is not great here, he looks a little like Andy Serkis. I might try again with a different picture because the tones are great, kind of like the silent movie stills I've been drawing. 

4B, which is now worn down to a tiny nub that Goodwin thinks is his size.
