The BBC is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11327442">reporting on a talk by archaeologist Michael Petraglia</a>, at the British Science Festival: 

<blockquote>But Dr Michael Petraglia, of Oxford University, and colleagues say stone artefacts found in the Arabian Peninsula and India point to an exodus starting about 70,000 to 80,000 years ago - and perhaps even earlier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I believe that multiple populations came out of Africa in the period between 120,000 and 70,000 years ago," he said. "Our evidence is stone tools that we can date."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most of the tools are from far inland - hundreds of kilometres from the coasts. This means it was more likely humans migrated by land than in boats, he said.</blockquote>

I think the Neandertal genome has pretty much killed the "southern route" theory that had modern humans beachcombing their way across the Bab-al-Mandab. 

Right now we're investigating the genetics, I'll hopefully be able to share some details soon.
