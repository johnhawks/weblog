From earlier this summer, <a href="http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/release.php?id=1555">good news on the CT-scan data front</a>: 

<blockquote><b>CARTA to Digitize Extensive Primate Collection This Summer</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>San Diego, June 16, 2009 -- To help trace the origins of the human species, and potential links to other primates, researchers with the Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny (CARTA) -- a joint organized research unit of the University of California, San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies -- will begin digitizing and examining skeletal specimens and related medical records this summer from more than two dozen chimpanzees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The resulting scans, using DICOM metadata and software, will allow CARTA members and other users to digitally manipulate the images for detailed analysis and instant digital measurement without ever handling the actual physical specimens. The CARTA databases will become available via the organization's newly created web site (http://carta.anthropogeny.org), which is also housed at SDSC, an organized research unit of UC San Diego.</blockquote>

The institute and SDSU have an IT infrastructure that should facilitate distributing the scans, which is really the challenge of making data like these available. The press release shows them working with open-source software, too.
