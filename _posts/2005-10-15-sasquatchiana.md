The AP <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9709214/">reports on the Texas Bigfoot Conference</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>JEFFERSON, Texas - Next to a lifelike replica of a giant ape head, the believers milled around tables Saturday covered with casts of large footprints, books about nature's mysteries and T-shirts proclaiming "Bigfoot: Often Imitated, Never Invalidated."</blockquote>

<blockquote>While they can have a sense of humor about it, the search for the legendary Sasquatch is no joke for many of the nearly 400 people who came here to discuss the latest sightings and tracking techniques at the Texas Bigfoot Conference.</blockquote>

Me: "Who do you think is worse, the Bigfoot people or the ID people?"
