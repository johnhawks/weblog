For readers in Wisconsin, I'll be doing two lectures on the Rising Star project and the discovery of <em>Homo naledi</em> at the end of next week.

First, at UW-Madison, I'll be talking at noon on Friday, October 31 in room 19 of Ingraham Hall:

Then, on Sunday, November 1 at 3:00 pm, I'll be at UW-Milwaukee to give a lecture sponsored by the Archaeological Institute of America:

UPDATE (2015-10-27): The location of this lecture has been changed to Physics room 137. 

These are both talks for the general public, and I'll be including footage from the field excavation, the story of the workshop that examined the fossils, and the major scientific findings. I'll also have 3D printed casts of the fossils on hand---people seem to love taking selfies with <em>Homo naledi</em>! 

If you are in the area and you want to know more about the discovery, I'll be looking forward to seeing you there!
