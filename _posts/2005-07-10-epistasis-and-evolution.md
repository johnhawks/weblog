<p>
Razib at Gene Expression has <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/through-rugged-roads-of-gene-land.php">a very informative post</a> referring to the edited volume <i>Epistasis and the Evolutionary Process</i> (Wolf et al. 2000). I'm posting a reference myself because I want to remember and return to the topic later.

<p>
It's full of Sewall Wright goodness.
