Emory University has done a nice story about Jessica Thompson's archaeological fieldwork in Malawi: <a href="http://news.emory.edu/features/2018/04/anthropology-malawi/index.html">"Bonding over bones, stones and beads"</a>.

<blockquote>Thompson's fieldwork in Malawi has uncovered hunter-gatherer remains that yielded DNA ranging in age from about 2,500 to 6,100 years old. And her work is ongoing at a site where a skeleton recovered in 1950 was recently dated to 8,100 years ago and also yielded DNA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The samples are by far the oldest-known human DNA from Africa, preserved by the cool, arid ecosystem of the highlands of northern Malawi.</blockquote>

University press sites often do a really nice job telling stories that give the day-to-day context of fieldwork. This is a great example, seeing the joy of students making discoveries and hearing the way that Thompson is planning her upcoming field season.
