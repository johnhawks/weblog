<p class="noindent" >I happened to be reading some literature on myostatin today and ran across a recent paper (<a  href="#XKostek:2009">Kostek et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a  href="#XKostek:2009">2009</a>). <p class="indent" >      <div class="quote">      <p class="noindent" >Conclusion:  <span  class="cmti-10">MSTN  </span>2379  A  <span  class="cmmi-10">&#x003E; </span>G  and  <span  class="cmti-10">FST  </span>-5003  A  <span  class="cmmi-10">&#x003E; </span>T  were      associated with baseline muscle strength and size among African      Americans  only.  These  ethnic-specific  associations  are  hypothesis      generating and should be confirmed in a larger sample of African      Americans.</div> <p class="indent" >   From that description, it looks like a gene-population association in the same vein as <span  class="cmti-10">APOE</span>, where an Alzheimer&#8217;s risk allele predicts disease incidence well in Europeans but not Africans. Myostatin regulates muscle growth, so here the idea would be that an allele has an effect that depends on genetic background, to the extent that might effect its evolution in those populations (<a  href="#XSaunders:2006">Saunders et&#x00A0;al.</a>&#x00A0;(<a  href="#XSaunders:2006">2006</a>) found that <span  class="cmti-10">myostatin </span>has two common alleles within Africa that look like they may have been recently selected, the two alleles are rare outside Africa). <p class="indent" >   Well, looking more deeply into the sample, we find that it&#8217;s not so impressive as it might look: <p class="indent" >      <div class="quote">      <p class="noindent" >Results: Baseline MVC was greater among African Americans who      were carriers of the <span  class="cmti-10">MSTN </span>G2379 allele (AG/GG, <span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 15) than the      A2379A homozygotes (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 8; 64<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>2 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>6<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>8 vs 49<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>8 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>8<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>7 kg). African      Americans who were carriers of the <span  class="cmti-10">FST  </span>T-5003 allele (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>=  12)      had greater baseline 1RM (11<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>9 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>0<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>7 vs 8<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>8 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>0<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>5 kg) and CSA      (24<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>4 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>1<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>3 vs 19<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>1 <span  class="cmsy-10"> </span>1<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>2 cm<sup><span  class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>) than African Americans with the      A-5003A genotype (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 14; <span  class="cmmi-10">P &#x003C; </span>0<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>05). No <span  class="cmti-10">MSTN </span>or <span  class="cmti-10">FST </span>genotype      and  muscle  phenotype  associations  were  found  among  the  other      ethnic groups (<span  class="cmmi-10">P </span><span  class="cmsy-10">&#x2265; </span>0<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>05).</div> <p class="indent" >   Those tiny sample sizes (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 15, <span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 8) come from stratifying a much larger sample (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 645) into ancestry groups. The very large European component of that large sample (<span  class="cmmi-10">n </span>= 509) showed no gene-phenotype associations. What&#8217;s left is a significant result (<span  class="cmmi-10">p &#x003C; </span>0<span  class="cmmi-10">.</span>05) considering only 23 people. <p class="indent" >   This may not be unusual &#8211; this allele is rare in Europeans, so the two samples may be pretty close to each other in statistical power. But it&#8217;s not exactly a vote of                                                                                                                                        confidence in favor of a large effect size for the allele, even within the small African-American sample. <p class="indent" >   That&#8217;s a common story in gene-phenotype association studies. Possibly it will replicate in a larger sample &#8211; and hopefully if it <span  class="cmti-10">doesn&#8217;t </span>replicate, somebody will still publish the result so that we&#8217;ll know about it. <p class="noindent" >    <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a   id="x1-2000"></a>References</h3> <p class="noindent" >   <div class="thebibliography">   <p class="bibitem" ><span class="biblabel"> <a   id="XKostek:2009"></a><span class="bibsp">&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Kostek MA, et&#x00A0;al. 2009.
