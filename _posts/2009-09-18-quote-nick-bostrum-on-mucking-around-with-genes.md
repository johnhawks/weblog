Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute is headed by <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/">Nick Bostrum</a>, who gave <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1921027,00.html">an interview to <i>Time</i> writer Eben Harrell: 

<blockquote>The view that the human genome is perfect just the way it is, is absurd. Even a cursory look at human history reveals there is also much in human nature that is horrifically bad. When a species with our track record thumps its chest and declares itself to be already perfect  with zero room for improvement  it is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. However, it doesn't follow from this that we will necessarily improve things if we start mucking around with our genes. We could make things worse.</blockquote>
