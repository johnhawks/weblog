Some nice coverage of Svante P&auml;&auml;bo in the <em>Washington Post</em> on the occasion of him winning one of the 3-million dollar "Breakthrough Awards" last week: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/11/10/3-science-ideas-youll-be-hearing-more-about-in-2016/">"3 science ideas you’ll be hearing more about in 2016"</a>: 

<blockquote>The traditional way to learn about extinct species is by digging up old bones or, in the case of early humans, examining stone tools they might have left behind. But what if you could learn about them by studying their DNA? Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology won a Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for pioneering the sequencing of ancient DNA and ancient genomes, with a focus on understanding the origins of modern humans, their relationships to extinct relatives such as Neanderthals, and the evolution of human populations and traits.</blockquote>
