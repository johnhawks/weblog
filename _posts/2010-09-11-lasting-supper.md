This is a great story about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8580146.stm">"portion sizes" increasing over the centuries in "Last Supper" paintings</a>, but I haven't been able to get the paper yet. 

<blockquote>The Cornell University team studied 52 of the most famous paintings of the Biblical scene over the millennium and scrutinised the size of the feast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They found the main courses, bread and plates put before Jesus and his disciples have progressively grown by up to two-thirds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This, they say, is art imitating life.</blockquote>

I wonder, though, how much of the "bread size grew by 23%" and "plate size increased by 66%" might be technological rather than merely food preference-caused. They introduced different plate production and bread production methods over time (not sure if all the breads are unleavened, either).
