While writing that last post, <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/geology/timescale/pleistocene-quaternary-redefinition-2009.html">about the redefinition of "Pleistocene"</a>, I went browsing through my archives. I was surprised to see that I haven't tagged a post <a href="http://johnhawks.net/taxonomy/term/177">"Pliocene"</a> for nearly two years! 

That just seems amazing to me. All the more so because the last few <a href="http://johnhawks.net/taxonomy/term/177">Pliocene-tagged posts</a> are pretty entertaining. Things got interesting for a while, and really quieted down since then. Well, there's stuff floating around out there; maybe we'll hear about some of it this summer?
