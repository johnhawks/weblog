Welcome to my webpage for Biology of Mind at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The course is listed as Anthropology, Neuroscience, Psychology and Zoology 619. 

The course has its own homepage hosted by the College of L&S, under their "collaborative sites" https://courses.lss.wisc.edu/anthro619/ 

As of September 8, all students should have now been added to the collaborative site. If you are enrolled in the course, you should be able to log into that website. All assignments, including review posts and comments, should be posted there. 

This page has a rolling schedule of lectures and readings for the course. Readings are linked here as they become available. Lecture visuals and video materials will also be linked or embedded here. Keep checking this page, or follow the feed.
