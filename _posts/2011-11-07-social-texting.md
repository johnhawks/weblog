My essay in <em>Anthropologies</em> (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/whats-wrong-with-anthropology-2011.html">"What's wrong with anthropology"</a>) is <a href="http://www.socialtextjournal.org/reviews/2011/10/review-of-david-graebers-debt.php">cited by Monalisa Gharavi in a review</a> for <em>Social Text</em> of David Graeber's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612191290/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1612191290"><em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>. 

I'm pointing to this because (a) one month is a much faster publication-to-citation conversion than is possible in print, and (b) <em>Social Text</em> is just one of those places where I didn't imagine I'd be cited.
