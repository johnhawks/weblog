Following up on <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/nagpra/university-california-reburial-2009.html">my post last month about repatriation issues at UCSD</a>, <i>Nature</i> has a news brief in this week's issue, reporting <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/458692c">that the Kumeyaay tribe's request for the bones has been put on hold</a>:

<blockquote>University chancellor Marye Anne Fox and president Mark Yudof nonetheless requested permission in February from federal officials to offer the Kumeyaay tribe the bones, which have been in dispute for more than two years (see Nature 455, 11561157; 2008). But Fox has now cancelled that request after Kumeyaay attorneys changed their plea for the bones, seeking university recognition of cultural affiliation.</blockquote>

No further details.
