Louis Leakey, writing in _Nature_ in 1966 as part of a defense of the _Homo habilis_ definition:

<blockquote>Even though <em>H. erectus</em> and the australopithecines share a number of cranial characters in their occipital bones, and in having a maximum width at the base of the skull, I have never been able to accept the view that <em>Australopithecus</em> represented a distinct ancestral stage leading to <em>H. erectus</em>, and I disagree even more strongly with the present suggestion of placing <em>H. habilis</em> between them. It places a hominid type which has a wholly distinct cranial morphology and one recalling the <em>H. sapiens</em> type between these two. It is possible that <em>H. habilis</em> may prove to be the direct ancestor of <em>H. sapiens</em>, but this can be no more than a theory at present. If true, it would mean that there had been two distinct species of the genus <em>Homo</em> at a very early stage&mdash;one leading to <em>H. erectus</em> and subsequent extinction and the other to <em>H. sapiens</em>. </blockquote>
John Robinson had in 1965 published an attack on <em>H. habilis</em>, claiming that the remains could not be distinguished from <em>Australopithecus</em> on the one hand, and that the <em>H. habilis</em> remains provided a possible intermediate toward <em>H. erectus</em> on the other hand. In his view, the situation was best handled by recognizing the gradual transformation of <em>Australopithecus</em> into <em>Homo erectus</em>, and not by erecting a new species between them. Phillip Tobias had responded to Robinson's attack, but did not disagree with Robinson's central point that <em>H. habilis</em> was a logical intermediate between <em>Australopithecus africanus</em> and <em>Homo erectus</em>. 

Leakey demurred from this point of view, and chose to write his own response to Robinson, in which he pointedly marked his disagreement with Tobias. Leakey could not see _H. habilis_ as an intermediate between _Australopithecus_ and _H. erectus_. His main argument was that the cranial form of <em>H. habilis</em> shared some derived features with _Homo sapiens_, whereas <em>H. erectus</em> was much more like <em>Australopithecus</em> in these same respects.

Leakey today is often associated with the concept of a very deep phylogenetic split between humans and the australopithecines. This short article is a very nice illustration of the morphological evidence that drove him toward that hypothesis.
