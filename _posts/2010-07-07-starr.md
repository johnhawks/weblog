Ringo Starr turns 70 years old today. Many are reminiscing about some music group he was apparently part of. As for myself, I will forever treasure his genius performance in the 1981 film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082146/"><i>Caveman</i></a>. 

What? That movie <b>totally launched Dennis Quaid's career!</b> That and <i>Jaws 3D</i>.
