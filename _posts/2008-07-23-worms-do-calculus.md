Another sign I'm not expecting enough of my students: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25822450/">"Worms do calculus to find food"</a>:

<blockquote>Worms calculate how much the strength of different tastes is changing -- equivalent to the process of taking a derivative in calculus -- to figure out if they are on their way toward food or should change direction and look elsewhere, says University of Oregon biologist Shawn Lockery, who thinks humans and other animals do the same thing.</blockquote>
