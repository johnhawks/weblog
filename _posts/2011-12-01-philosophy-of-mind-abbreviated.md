If there could be such a thing as a 2000-word highlights version of Philosophy of Mind, Laura Weed <a href="http://philosophynow.org/issue87/Philosophy_of_Mind_An_Overview">has written it for <em>Philosophy Now</em>.</a>. I find myself teaching this material every couple of years in my course, Biology of Mind, and I'm glad to put in a link that I can revisit next fall.
