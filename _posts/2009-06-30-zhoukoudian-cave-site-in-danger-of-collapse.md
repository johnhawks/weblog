From <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-06/25/content_8321603.htm"><i>China Daily</i></a>: 

<blockquote>Reinforcement has begun at the Peking Man site to prevent one of its walls from collapsing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The protective excavation, which started Wednesday, focuses on the west section of the cave where the first Peking Man skull, hundreds of thousands of years old, was found in Zhoukoudian, 46 kms from downtown Beijing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The west section is the only part that has remained untouched since the cave's discovery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Repair work cannot be done without a comprehensive excavation," Gao Xing, deputy director and research fellow of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Palaeoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a press conference Wednesday.</blockquote>

Xinhua news agency has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/24/content_11595125.htm">a short history of excavations</a> at the site, although it omits Weidenreich's role entirely, and misses the details of the 1960's excavations beyond a mention.
