<i>USA Today</i> says, <a href="http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/dispatches/post/2010/10/bedbugs-bite-hotels-terror-/126912/1">"Let the bedbugs bite."</a>

<blockquote>As a veteran traveler who's spent many nights in airport hotels, roadside chains and dodgy guesthouses - heck, I even braved the Dirtiest Hotel in America and lived to tell the tale - I've never seen or suffered the consequences of a bedbug. Although I know of people whose hotel stays have been ruined by waking up with red, mosquito bite-like welts, the creepy crawlies are not known to transmit diseases.</blockquote>

I'm tired of reading that "bedbugs don't transmit diseases." Guess what: <b>If there were a disease that woke me up in the night with red welts, I'd want someone to find a cure!</b>
