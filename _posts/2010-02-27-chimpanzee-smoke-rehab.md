<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35602234/ns/technology_and_science-science/">Gretchen sends along a pearl of animal news:</a>

<blockquote>A Russian chimpanzee has been sent to rehab by zookeepers to cure the smoking and beer-drinking habits he has picked up, a popular daily reported on Friday.</blockquote>

Chimp detox I can understand. I mean, they live in cages, and people bring them cigarettes and beer. It's not like the chimp can walk down to the Quickie Mart and cash in some aluminum cans for smoke money. 

But chimp <b>rehab</b>? Where exactly do you <b>send</b> a chimp for rehab? Are we talking leather couches and nicotine gum?

<blockquote>It added he has now been transferred to the city of Kazan, about 500 miles east of Moscow, for rehabilitation treatment.</blockquote>

Hmmm...seems the key element of chimpanzee rehab is <b>taking the chimpanzee away from people who provide endless cigarettes and beer</b>. Which seems like an inherently bad idea. 

UPDATE (2010-02-27): A reader writes: 

<blockquote>Here is a pic of that chimp, Zhora (Russian short name for Georgij/George):

Turns out, it was his trainer in circus who tought Zhora to drink and smoke. He lights up all on his own and drinks from the glass - the "scene in restaurant" was his main number in circus. The chimp seems to be perfectly adapted to agriculture - his favorite food is milk with fresh bread :-))

He became aggressive in circus and was transferred to the zoo:

The "rehab" is simply a different zoo, one with more resources, more experienced staff and, it is hoped, a little more civilized visitors.</blockquote>
