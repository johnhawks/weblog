<blockquote> The British couple’s only child, a son, had died suddenly in a motorcycle accident, at the young age of 26. Somehow, the son’s body wasn’t recovered for two full days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But after the discovery of the body, his parents apparently jumped into action quickly; they had their son’s sperm extracted from his body. Once extracted, the parents began the process of trying to use the sperm to bring into the world their own grandchild. Oh boy.</blockquote>

With a donor egg and a surrogate, the couple now has a three-year-old biological grandchild. The linked article goes into the legal aspects, including the problem that this was all impossible in the U.K., where the couple lives, and so they brought their grandchild into the world in the U.S.
