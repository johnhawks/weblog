The local station is playing the "creationism" episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> today -- maybe in honor of Darwin this week? A Marge Simpson quote from the end: 

<blockquote>Thank you for opening my eyes, Lisa. I can't wait to see what evolution will do next! Maybe a bird with a people face. Or a bear with pants on. </blockquote>
