This Friday, October 14, I'll be appearing in Anaheim, CA, at the National Association of Biology Teachers conference. I'm part of a symposium sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), titled <a href="https://www.nescent.org/media/NABTSymposium2011.php">"Changing humans in a changing environment."</a> 

It's a fantastic set of presentations on human evolution from the behavior of our ape relatives, the origin and evolution of <em>Homo</em> and new insights coming from ancient genomes (that's my part). The other presenters are Jill Pruetz, Rick Potts and Susan Antn. The symposium will be webcast live, and I can share the instructions for seeing it in progress: 

<blockquote>Even if you cant make it to this years meeting in Anaheim, you can still watch the symposium via live webcast.Tune in Friday, October 14 from 4:30-8:30 PM EST (1:30-5:30 PM PST).</blockquote>

<blockquote>To view the live, free webcast, simply go to http://dukeuniversity.acrobat.com/nabt2011 at 1:30 pm Pacific/4:30 pm Eastern and log in as a guest.  (Note: We suggest you do this in advance to test the connection and make sure you can access the site without problems.  When you log in successfully you'll see a "Congratulations" message.  If you have problems, please contact eog@nescent.org.)</blockquote>

I think I'm fourth in the order, and my presentation is titled, "New discoveries from ancient genomes". That's pretty much what all of my talks are titled lately, but many discoveries actually <em>are</em> new in each one. I'm reporting things as we figure out how to do them!
