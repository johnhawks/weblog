I just got a spam e-mail, trying to sell online degrees "in these challenging economic times". They have a bunch of professions and projected numbers of jobs before 2012. At the bottom of the list, I see this: 

<blockquote><b>Forensic Science Technician</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>Average annual salary: $70,760</blockquote>
<blockquote>Projected New Forensic Technician Jobs by 2012: 140,000</blockquote>

We're going to mobilize the adult population of Madison into "Forensic Science Technicians" in the next three years? Each of our 50 states is going to hire 1000 new "Forensic Science Technicians" per year? If you believe that, I've got an online degree program to sell you!
