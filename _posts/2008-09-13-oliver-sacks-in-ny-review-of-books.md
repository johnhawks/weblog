Oliver Sacks <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21774?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_content=169898384&utm_campaign=Sept+25+issue&utm_term=A+Summer+of+Madness">reviews the new book, <i>Hurry Down Sunshine</i></a> in the current <i>New York Review of Books</i>. It's an interesting read, coupled with Sacks' own experiences and a rundown of some older literature on manic-depressive disorder. 

<blockquote>These are the paradoxes that surround what Hughlings Jackson, the nineteenth-century neurologist, called "super-positive" states: they betoken disorder, imbalance in the nervous system, but their energy, their euphoria, makes them feel like supreme health. Some patients may achieve a startled insight into this, as did one patient of mine, a very old lady with neurosyphilis. Becoming more and more vivacious in her early nineties, she said to herself, "You're feeling too well, you must be ill." George Eliot, similarly, spoke of herself as feeling "dangerously well" before the onset of her migraine attacks.</blockquote>

I want to point out that Dr. House had an elderly neurosyphilis patient in one of last year's episodes, with similar outcome. I thought this part of the review will be valuable for my Biology of Mind students, pondering notions of self: 

<blockquote>If there is uncertainty in a patient's mind about what is "physical" and what is "mental," there may be a still deeper uncertainty as to what is self or not-selfas with my patient Frances D., who, as she grew more excited on L-dopa, was taken over by strange passions and images which she could not dismiss as entirely alien to her "real self." Did they, she wondered, come from very deep but previously suppressed parts of herself? But these patients, unlike Sally, knew that they were on a drug, and could see, all around them, similar effects taking hold on the others.</blockquote>
