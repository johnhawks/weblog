Sometimes scientific visualization leads to very interesting pictures:

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/slc24a5-linkage-array.png" alt="Genetic linkage around SLC24A5" />
</div>

This shows the mutual information between pairs of SNPs in the sample of Gujarat origin people from Houston, 400 kilobases upstream and downstream of the gene <i>SLC24A5</i>.
