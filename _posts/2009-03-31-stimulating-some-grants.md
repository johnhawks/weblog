In case you're wondering whether you have a chance at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=114483&govDel=USNSF_51">some of that stimulus money for your grant proposal</a>: 

<blockquote>NSF already has many highly rated research proposals in hand to consider for funding with ARRA funds. Some research proposals have already been reviewed and others are in the review process. NSF is planning to use the majority of the $2 billion available in Research and Related Activities for proposals that are already in house and will be reviewed and/or awarded prior to Sept. 30, 2009.</blockquote>

If you're in, you're already in. If not, better luck next recession.
