Gina Kolata profiles Eric Lander, director of Harvard and MIT's Broad Institute and advisor to President Obama, in the <em>New York Times</em>. It's a good read for those interested in the recent history of genetics, and where it may be going from the perspective of one of the largest sequencing centers. 

I also learned a lot from the descriptions of Lander in Jamie Shreeve's recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345433742/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345433742"><em>The Genome War: How Craig Venter Tried to Capture the Code of Life and Save the World</em></a>. I really enjoyed the book, and if I have time I'll do a full review.
