Software designer and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5926282/why-dave-winer-invented-the-blog">blogging pioneer Dave Winer</a>: 

<blockquote>Then something great happened. Gates read my email, and responded with a total Bill Gates rant, and of course I sent it back to my readers. I would say that's roughly when blogging was born. I know some people disagree. But from that point on, no one questioned the power of an individual with a net connection and a scripting language.</blockquote>
