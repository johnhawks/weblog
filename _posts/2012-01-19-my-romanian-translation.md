I'm pleased to note that <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/diet">my diet category</a> now is available in <a href="http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/reviews-ohnhawks-ro">a Romanian translation</a>. The translation is courtesy of Alexander Ovsov, and although it is not the first (I've approved some Spanish translations of a few pages), I hope that I can encourage more translations. If you are interested in doing one, just let me know and we can probably work something out.
