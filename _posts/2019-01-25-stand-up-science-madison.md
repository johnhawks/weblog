On Tuesday evening, January 29, I'll be taking part in a show at Comedy on State here in Madison, with comedian Shane Mauss: <a href="http://www.shanemauss.com/club-dates-1/2019/1/29/madison-wi">"Stand-up comedians + scientists = Stand Up Science"</a>.

<blockquote>Award-winning stand-up comedian and science podcast host Shane Mauss presents Stand Up Science!  </blockquote>

<blockquote>Learn and laugh as local scientists, comedians and other special guests join Shane to bring you an unforgettable 2 hour show that is equal parts ahas and hahas </blockquote>

<blockquote>Stand-up comedy and science have a lot in common. They both reveal truth, change our perceptions, and challenge the status quo. So why are they so underappreciated?  Admittedly, comedy sometimes underestimates the intelligence of their audience, catering to the lowest common denominator. And science has the stigma of being overly complicated, unrelatable or boring. Until now. </blockquote>

Should be a fun evening, and if you're in Madison, you should check it out!
