Darwin, in the sixth edition of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, p. 421:

<blockquote>[A]s my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous positionnamely, at the close of the Introductionthe following words: "I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification." This has been of no avail. <b>Great is the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure.</b></blockquote>
