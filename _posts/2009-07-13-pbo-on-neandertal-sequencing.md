On <i>Edge</i>, Svante P&auml;&auml;bo has <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paabo09/paabo09_index.html">a long and interesting narrative</a> about Neandertal genetics, <i>FoxP2</i> mice, his own biography, and everything else. Nothing new to be had, but much interesting background about old stuff. 

How can I resist quoting this passage? 

<blockquote>Probably the most likely thing was that this was introduced at 454 at the same time they were sequencing Jim Watson  I wouldn't be totally surprised if we tried to investigate this and there was some slight mixture of Jim Watson with the Neanderthal sequence there.</blockquote>

Poor Watson -- his DNA has been everywhere!

And why paleoanthropologists have such big arguments: 

<blockquote>As an outsider to paleontologists, I'm often rather surprised about how much scientists fight in paleontology. And I am thinking about why that is the case. Why do we have less vicious fights in molecular biology, for example? I suppose the reason is that paleontology is a rather data-poor science. There are probably more paleontologists than there are important fossils in the world. To make a name for yourself is to find a new interpretation for those fossils that are extant. This always goes against some earlier person's interpretation, who will not like it very much.</blockquote>

Yes, I'm sure it's true. But you have to admit we have better taste in wine.
