In between. Much more fun while watching than <i>Temple of Doom</i> -- mainly due to the lack of any annoyances as great as Kate Capshaw or Spielberg's mid-80's use of kids. Why didn't they bring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000261/">Karen Allen</a> back sooner?
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, many, many more logical holes than <i>Last Crusade</i>, many fewer fun scenes, and too many superhuman feats of endurance. And a retread of Spielberg's late-80's use of splattering goop. And did I mention the logical holes?
</p>

<p>
And a new annoyance: bad CGI. Did we really need animated prairie dogs?
</p>

<p>
By the way, that kid in the library to whom Indy gives a V. Gordon Childe reference was Tom Hanks' and Rita Wilson's son <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2721320/">Chet Hanks</a>.
