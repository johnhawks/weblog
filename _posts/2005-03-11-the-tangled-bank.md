A blog carnival is a selection of self-submitted articles following a theme of topics. A good one in the area of science and medicine is 
<a href="http://tangledbank.net/">The Tangled Bank</a>.

<p>
The current edition includes
<a href="http://mixingmemory.blogspot.com/2005/02/how-evolutionary-psychology-can-make.html">this great post</a> with an unforgettable title: "How Evolutionary Psychology Can Make You Look Like an Ass." The article is an illustration of uninformed use of EP concepts, and a complaint about how common they are. It's short, and worth thinking about.
