It's that time of year again, when students all over the country are facing their first writing assignment. I always encourage a bloggy style -- concise, journalistic, and thesis-driven. 

Well, I don't even manage that ideal myself a lot of the time, but here's some useful writing advice from Copyblogger. First, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/long-or-short-post/">"Do long blog posts scare away readers?"</a>. Well, they don't scare away mine, but I can always use suggestions for how to punch things up (or, like overleavened dough, down). 

So I highly recommend the follow-up, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/write-with-a-knife/">"How to write with a knife"</a>. One piece of advice I like: 

<blockquote>2. Cut the first paragraph</blockquote>

<blockquote>...Try cutting the first paragraph or two from your post and see what happens. You may find a much more powerful opening.</blockquote>

That technique would work wonders for more than half the student papers I grade. I always underline the thesis statement (or at least the best facsimile of one I can find) and an awful lot of the time, it's there at the beginning or end of the second paragraph. 

There are six more recommendations at the link, and I can see my students in every one of them. (Not to mention myself).
