I was talking about language dispersals today, and so this piece by Nigel Williams in <i>Current Biology</i> is topical: <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(10)01345-X">"New language found".</a> The article describes the "discovery" (by linguists) of a language isolate in northeastern India. 

<blockquote>Only about 800 elder speakers were found and the language is not written, [Gregory] Anderson says.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although the Koro speakers live in remote hillsides, it is unclear how the language came about amongst the surrounding 10,000 person Aka tribe.</blockquote>

Well, a history of expansion of other languages at the expense of Koro -- maybe Aka but not primarily so in recent years considering the much more massive growth of languages now spoken by millions in India.
