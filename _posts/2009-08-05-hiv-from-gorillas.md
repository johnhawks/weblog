A new strain of HIV has come from gorillas: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/science/05hiv.html">"New Strain of H.I.V. Is Discovered"</a>

<blockquote>All three other known strains of the human immunodeficiency virus, H.I.V.-1, have been linked to chimpanzees. But genetic tests showed that the new virus was closely related to a recently recognized gorilla virus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The most likely explanation for the new viruss emergence is gorilla-to-human transmission, probably a result of humans slaughtering apes or handling or eating their meat.</blockquote>
