An interesting factoid from <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/why_it_is_important_for_media.php">Bora Zivkovic</a>, writing about PLoS media coverage: 

<blockquote>First, as you probably already know, PLoS makes no distinction between Old and New media. We have bloggers on our press list who apply/sign-up in the same way and abide by the same rules as traditional journalists (and, unlike mainstream media, bloggers NEVER break embargos, not once in the past three years since we started adding bloggers to our press list).</blockquote>
