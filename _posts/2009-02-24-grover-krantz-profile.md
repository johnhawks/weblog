A reader forwards <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400992.html?referrer=emailarticle">this article from the <i>Washington Post</i>: 

<blockquote>In a dim hallway in the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, anthropologist David Hunt opens a dingy green cabinet and pulls out a drawer full of human bones.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This," he says, "is Grover Krantz."</blockquote>

If you're an anthropologist, that's all you will need to see to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400992.html?referrer=emailarticle">follow the link</a> and read the whole thing. If not, you may need a little more: 

<blockquote>"Grover kept a lot of stuff," he says. "These are his baby teeth."</blockquote>

Or:

<blockquote>Working at the Berkeley museum, Krantz broke his big toe in a particularly memorable manner: He dropped the Dead Sea Scrolls on it.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400992.html?referrer=emailarticle">Click the link</a>. You know you want to. And you'll find a sweet story of a misunderstood anthropologist, the dog he loved, and a death spent teaching. 

Oh, and Bigfoot, too.
