<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/health/28book.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">Abigail Zuger in the Science <i>Times</i> reviews</a> the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0922233349?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0922233349"><i>Dissection: Photographs of a Rite of Passage in American Medicine 1880-1930</i></a>. The book presents a collection of photos from early 20th-century anatomy dissection classes. It seems to build on the fascination with "Body Worlds" with a historical angle: 

<blockquote>[H]undreds of these photographs endure. John Harley Warner, chairman of Yales History of Medicine program, and James M. Edmonson, curator of a museum of medical memorabilia at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, have culled more than 100 for what might under other circumstances be considered a coffee-table book. It is a striking, glossy, oversize volume, immensely decorative if shredded flesh and the odd bone are your idea of dcor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But as ghoulish as the cadavers in these shots may be  they range from pristine, untouched corpses to unrecognizable piles of picked-over remains  their shock value diminishes with each turned page. Conversely, the attention commanded by the groups of young students self-consciously posed around the dissecting table never wanes.</blockquote>

According to Amazon, the book is 208 pages. Here's the cover:

Sounds interesting -- I think I might get a copy to have in my office for students...
