<blockquote>"Perhaps amazingly, [paranormal beliefs] are not related at all to education," Stark said. "Ph.D.s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in Bigfoot, Loch Ness Monster, ghosts, etc."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The 2006 study of college students, done by Bryan Farha at Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward Jr. of the University of Central Oklahoma, reached a similar conclusion. Belief in the paranormal -- from astrology to communicating with the dead -- increases during college, rising from 23 percent among freshmen to 31 percent in seniors and 34 percent among graduate students.</blockquote>

The article also touches on the inverse relation between religious belief and belief in the paranormal. 

UPDATE (2008/08/24): Razib <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/08/who_believes_in_astrology.php">posts numbers</a> that cast doubt on these relations, at least with respect to the attitude that astrology "has some scientific truth." Maybe this is too convenient a correlation to disbelieve? (In the category of "college makes you more likely to believe BS psychology studies?")
