If you want to give yourself a caveman (or cavewoman) makeover, well, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37095461/ns/technology_and_science-wireless/">now there's an app for that:</a>

<blockquote>The MEanderthal app (a combination of "me" and "Neanderthal") just released by the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for the iPhone or Android, is grounded in science. It relies on what is known about the appearance of our closest extinct relatives, the Neanderthals, to transform your face into the face of an early human.</blockquote>

The art is based on John Gurche's reconstructions, so I guess you'll be Gurchelating yourself. Gurchetizing?
