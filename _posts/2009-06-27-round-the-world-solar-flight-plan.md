Can I just say, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31569560/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/">Bertrand Piccard is awesome</a>? 

<blockquote>Adventurer Bertrand Piccard on Friday unveiled the Solar Impulse, which, with its sleek white wings and pink trimming, aims to make history as the prototype for a solar-powered flight around the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Yesterday it was a dream, today it is an airplane, tomorrow it will be an ambassador of renewable energies," said Piccard, who in 1999 copiloted the first round-the-globe nonstop balloon flight.</blockquote>
