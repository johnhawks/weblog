<blockquote><b>Early Humans Finally Drunk Enough To Invent Dancing</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While human beings had experimented with rudimentary forms of shimmying and gyration as early as the Neanderthal period, it was not until they were able to reach critical levels of utter inebriation that early cultures finally began to let their hair down and really cut loose," said Yu Wei Lin of the Beijing Institute of Dance Studies.</blockquote>
