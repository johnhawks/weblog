Claudia Dreifus <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09conv.html">profiles</a> biological anthropologist Nina Jablonski in today's <i>NY Times</i>. She has a new book out, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520242815?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520242815"><i>Skin, A Natural History</i></a>.

<blockquote>Modern humans, we love to alter our skin. You'll find very few people walking around today with unadorned skin. They might make permanent changes -- piercing, scarring, tattooing -- to memorialize events and announce their identity. Or they might use cosmetics for temporary alterations to announce their attractiveness, mood or sexual availability. The bottom line: humans are the self-decorating ape.</blockquote>

The interview includes questions about skin color, cosmetics, and the first fossil chimpanzee.
