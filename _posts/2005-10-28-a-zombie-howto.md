<p>
In honor of the season, HowStuffWorks.com has <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/zombie.htm">an article on the workings of zombies</a>. 
</p>

<i>Nota bene</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Mummies can bear a striking resemblance to zombies, even down to the guttural speech and shambling walk. Their deliberate physical preservation, however, sets them apart from ordinary zombies. </blockquote>

<p>
Here is some good advice if zombies are chasing you: 
</p>

<blockquote>Also, avoid common mistakes like:
<ul>
<li>Sheltering in a vehicle to which you do not have the keys</li>
<li>Leaving blades, cudgels or other basic weapons out for zombies to find</li>
<li>Teaching zombies how to use firearms</li>
<li>Giving your only weapon to anyone who is hysterical</li>
<li>Retreating to a basement or cellar without taking supplies with you</li>
<li>Getting into an elevator in a building infested with zombies</li>
<li>Letting personal feelings and arguments get in the way of survival</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
My favorite part? When I viewed the article, there was a list of "popular searches" on the sidebar. The "popular searches": Bounty Hunting, Dreams, Halloween, Tarot Card, Witchcraft, and <i>Creationism</i>!
