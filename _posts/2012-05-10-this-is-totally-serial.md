<blockquote>The solution is obvious: universities must stop outsourcing vital functions to publishers. They need to shift the currency of academic success from the title of the journal in which a scholars works are published to the inherent quality of their research. And they need to immediately stop spending money on journal subscriptions, investing instead in the new forms of scholarly communication appropriate for the Internet age.</blockquote>
