IBM joins the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/science/06dna.html">next-gen sequencing race</a>: 

<blockquote>The I.B.M. approach is based on what the company describes as a DNA transistor, which it hopes will be capable of reading individual nucleotides in a single strand of DNA as it is pulled through an atomic-size hole known as a nanopore. A complete system would consist of two fluid reservoirs separated by a silicon membrane containing an array of up to a million nanopores, making it possible to sequence vast quantities of DNA at once.</blockquote>
