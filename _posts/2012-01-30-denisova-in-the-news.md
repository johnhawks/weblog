Hey, I'm in the <em>New York Times</em> today!

It's a story about the Denisova genome and its possible relationships to recent human populations. We have been concentrating here on the Neandertals for the last few months, but I did get some analyses run on Denisova last week (thanks in large part to my grad student, Aaron Sams, who lifted over the genome from the old to new genetic map coordinates). I'll share some of those results soon.
