This etiquette guide from <i>Nature Education</i> is enormously useful for students: <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/e-mail-13953985">"How to send a professional e-mail to a professor"</a>. 

I could not possibly count the number of "Hey, John" e-mails I've gotten from undergraduates who were never taught any better. I'm not an e-mail snob, but some do get answered much more promptly than others.
