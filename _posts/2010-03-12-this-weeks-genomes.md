Actress Glenn Close joins the ranks of the genomed; <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/03/celebrity_genomics_without_the.php">Daniel MacArthur discusses the celebrity genomics trend</a>. 

He covers in greater detail <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/03/whole_genome_sequences_dont_al.php#more">the James Lupski genome story</a>, in which the geneticist sequences his own genome to find out what causes his own genetic disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Beside that success story, he places a second study this week that had a lot more trouble -- a case in which complete genome sequencing of four members of a family could not by itself find the causative variant for two siblings' Miller syndrome. 

<blockquote>The basic problem here is that <b>we're still extremely bad at differentiating between mutations causing serious disease and perfectly benign polymorphisms</b> - each of us have genomes littered with genetic variants that look like nasty mutations but have little or no effect on health. In fact, Lupski's genome illustrates this nicely: one of the mutations causing his disease is a premature stop codon that disrupts the function of a gene - but <b>his genome also contains an additional 120 stop codons disrupting other genes</b>, presumably without severe health effects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So all of us are walking around with hundreds of gene-disrupting variants, and finding the single causative gene amongst all that noise is seriously challenging. </blockquote>

We've been talking about stop codons and pseudogenes a lot here in the Hawks lab this week.
