Earnest Hooton, discussing the Taung Child in <em>Up from the Ape</em> (p. 284): 

<blockquote>More temperate in our Australopithecine enthusiasm than Dart, we nevertheless must admit that here was a near-man (although still predominantly an ape) that failed of his destiny, if that was ultimately human. On the basis of teeth alone, it might have been claimed that Australopithecus was human. However, we must now admit that teeth do not make the man, although I am inclined to think that the loss of them may ultimately unmake him.</blockquote>
