Michael E. Smith's post, <a href="http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2011/11/war-stories-from-academic-job.html">"War stories from academic job interviews"</a> is too good not to share. He describes several of his job interview experiences, with characteristic good humor and honesty about the ones that were "bad faith". 

<blockquote>A question from a graduate student after my talk effectively destroyed the entire conceptual foundation of my talk. Absolutely buried me! Deader than a doornail. The interviewee's worst nightmare. As soon as the question was posed, I realized I was sunk. Yet I had this flash that the answer to the contradiction was just at my fingertips, but I couldn't bring it in. I did not get an offer (surprise, surprise). Later I figured out how to resolve the conceptual contradiction that burned me, and got some mileage out of it in a couple of articles. In the acknowledgements of one, I thanked an anonymous graduate student for asking the right question at the wrong time. But after that experience, I was bullet-proof at interviews.</blockquote>

I've always had great fun on academic job interviews. There were times when it was obvious I wasn't getting the job, but even so, there were always people in the department I really got along well with. I always look forward to meeting new people and hearing their stories, and sharing mine!
