Reuters has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29058647/">a little story about CT scans of Lucy</a>, done at the University of Texas by John Kappelman and colleagues:

<blockquote>Scientists hope studying a "virtual" Lucy will offer further clues about the human ancestor's lifestyle. Lucy, found in Ethiopia in 1974, is the best-preserved example of Australopithecus, a species of pre-human.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It opens it up to people who, instead of having to travel to some distant museum to see the original, can actually call it up on the desktop," Kappelman said.</blockquote>

I can't wait to call it up on my desktop. If bringing fossils to the States will get us scans of everything, then we need another "Ancestors" exhibit!
