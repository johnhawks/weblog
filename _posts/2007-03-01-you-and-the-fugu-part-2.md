My <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/evo-devo/you_and_fugu_noncoding_conserved.html">earlier post</a> introduced the conserved noncoding elements shared by vertebrates. Those elements shared by vertebrates seem to be crucial to regulating developmental genes, and are not found in any invertebrates.  Now a current paper by Tanya Vavouri and colleagues reports that <i>other</i> conserved noncoding elements have evolved in parallel in worms. 
</p>

<p>
I'm posting it because it gives another good mini-introduction to these conserved seqeunces in vertebrates: 
</p>

<blockquote>Comparisons of the human genome against the genomes of distantly related vertebrates have revealed an abundance of highly conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) that appear to have been 'frozen' throughout vertebrate evolution [1-7]. The exact number of elements shared between any set of species varies depending on the precise definition of similarity and the divergence of the genomes used. For example, a comparison of the human genome against the mouse and the rat genomes revealed that all three share 256 elements with no evidence of transcription that are 100% identical over at least 200 base-pairs (bp) [2]. Furthermore, the human genome and the genome of the Japanese pufferfish (<i>Fugu rubripes</i>), which diverged from a common ancestor approximately 450 million years ago (MYA), share 1,373 CNEs, with an average length of 199 bp and average identity of 84% [4].</blockquote>

<blockquote>A striking property of human CNEs is that they cluster in genomic regions that contain genes coding for transcription factors and signaling genes involved in the regulation of development ('trans-dev' genes) [2-4,6]. Therefore, CNEs have been proposed to act as cis-regulatory sequences for these trans-dev genes. In support of this, where tested, the majority of assayed CNEs can act as tissue-specific enhancers for a transgene in zebrafish or mice [4,7-10].</blockquote>

<p>
So it looks like the first ten references in the paper are an essential group to review in terms of outlining the regulation of vertebrate developmental genes. I've pasted them in below; it's a field that has originated largely within the last three years.
