Action-packed day today as I did some filming with Matt Sponheimer and a great team of scientists doing some field ecology in the Cradle nature reserve. The morning was field collection of plants for testing of mechanical properties and nutritional content; the afternoon I tagged along on a primate-spotting venture with James Loudon and Daryl Codron. We caught up with a wary troop of baboons and witnessed a real fracas between an adult male and some juveniles. 

Here's some of the landscape around sunset.
