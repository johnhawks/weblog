Approaching a new semester, and NPR wants us to know that the hot trend in physics is to get rid of lectures: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/01/01/144550920/physicists-seek-to-lose-the-lecture-as-teaching-tool">"Physicists seek to lose the lecture as a teaching tool"</a>. 

<blockquote>At a recent class, the students  nearly 100 of them  are in small groups discussing a question. Three possible answers to the question are projected on a screen. Before the students start talking with one another, they use a mobile device to vote for their answer. Only 29 percent got it right. After talking for a few minutes, [professor Eric] Mazur tells them to answer the question again.

This time, 62 percent of the students get the question right. Next, Mazur leads a discussion about the reasoning behind the answer. The process then begins again with a new question. This is a method Mazur calls "peer Instruction." He now teaches all of his classes this way.</blockquote>

I've been tracking this trend since a 2007 <em>NY Times</em> profile of Mazur (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/teaching/mazur_problem-based_physics_2007.html">"'The sage on the stage'"</a>). 


Chris Rowan ponders, <a href="http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/2012/01/how-useful-are-lectures-really/">"How useful are lectures, really"</a>, writing from the perspective of geology. That's a lot more similar to evolutionary biology than is physics, because historical examples, practical exercises and theory all must form a coherent whole. 

<blockquote>Ive read a few of these [stories about physics lecture obsolescence] in the last few months, and in some ways I feel they set up a false dichotomy between all lectures and no lectures, when the reality is usually some lectures. I certainly feel, as did most people who joined the discussion on Twitter, that lecturing should not be the be-all and end-all of the teaching experience, but it still has a place.</blockquote>
