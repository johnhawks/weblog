Here's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12738644">the story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Officials seized the creature after noticing its white fur was scattered with brown patches and that it had the long claws and humped back of a grizzly. Now a DNA test has confirmed that it is indeed a hybrid -- possibly the first documented in the wild.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We've known it's possible, but actually most of us never thought it would happen," said Ian Stirling, a polar bear biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service in Edmonton.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Polar bears and grizzlies have been successfully paired in zoos before -- Stirling could not speculate why -- and their offspring are fertile.</blockquote>

It seems to me it would be a lot more useful for all the Bigfoot-hunting types to go looking for rare hybrids. We would certainly learn a lot more from it.
