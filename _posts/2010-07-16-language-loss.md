I'm sympathetic to recognizing the real loss that accompanies the disappearance of a language from the world of speakers. The "unique oral history" and "lost in translation" ideas are true as far as they go -- the value of folk art and oral history is that they enable social relationships. 

But most communities of a few hundred speakers don't have a Beowulf. Unique perspectives and unique history, to be sure -- just as every Rembrandt is unique. But every Rembrandt is not the <i>Night Watch</i>. Most unique perspectives are about the speaker's life. At some point we can't learn the stories of all our ancestors anyway, because there are simply too many of them. Obviously I think we should enable people to learn about their history, yet we can't keep communities pinned like butterflies in a cabinet of curiosities. 

Human language communities in prehistory had a few hundred to a few thousand speakers. Those communities shared the same basic social lives and needs. Ninety-five percent or more of all those languages were lost -- and those remaining have mostly come from a handful of languages less than 10,000 years ago. 

I read in the Rijksmuseum that art historians figure more than 95% of the work of artists from the Dutch golden age had been lost or destroyed over the last 300 years.
