I just want to quickly thank all you readers who are following the site on <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>. I've been doing an audit of my stats from different sources, and I was totally humbled to discover that 9,176 people are subscribed. I mean, I'm really awestruck. 

The total is a little misleading, since it certainly includes many people who signed up long ago and don't read the site often, or don't still follow their old accounts. Longevity at one address is a good way to accumulate subscriptions. 

But it's a bit of a blind spot for me because RSS syndicators essentially bundle many people's reading into few robot visits to the site. I give out the entire text of my site by feed, so it's easy to follow that way without clicking through. So again, I say thanks to everyone reading that way!
