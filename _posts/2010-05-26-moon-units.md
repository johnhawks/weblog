NPR has <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127072804&ft=1&f=1007">a story about public analysis of data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>: 

<blockquote>Only one problem: The LRO is doing such a good job that the scientists can't keep up.

Enter Oxford astrophysicist Chris Lintott. He's asking amateur astronomers to help review, measure and classify tens of thousands of moon photos streaming to Earth. He has set up the website MoonZoo.org, where anyone can log on, get trained and become a space explorer....For example, "we ask people to count the craters that they can see ... and that tells us all sorts of things about the history and the age of that bit of surface," Lintott explains.</blockquote>

I wonder if we could crowd-source morphology? I'd prefer a majority-rules approach to some of the bickering about which features are present or absent. The article mentions how they deal statistically with mistakes in classification.
