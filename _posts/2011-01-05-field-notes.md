The <i>NY Times'</i> "Notes from the field" feature is <a href="http://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/evidence-of-mammals-and-legumes-22-million-years-old/">following paleobotanist Bonnie Jacobs</a>, working a fossil field locality in the Mush Valley of Ethiopia: 

<blockquote>None of us has ever experienced a site like this. Not only are the shales full of leaf fossils, but we have now also found beautiful and important fossil bones, including the tooth of a small mammal and the scapula of an artiodactyl. (This is an order of hoofed animals that are also known as even-toed ungulates  picture a mammal that walks on its tippy-toes, like a gazelle.)

These discoveries mean there is great potential for finding other mammals here, including primates. This site will fill a gap in the record of African vertebrate evolution  there are no others of this age known.</blockquote> 

The fossils are 22 million years old, which would be a wonderful time to have primates represented. I hope they find some!
