Regarding <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2189">advice for new college students</a>: 

<blockquote>I also suggest that as soon as you can get in a lab, go regularly research seminars and then ask as many questions of your lab mates as they will put up with.  It really leapfrogs the knowledge base.</blockquote>

Good suggestion for those going into science. The sophomores who have put themselves in labs are already halfway into graduate school, even if they don't know it. 

I suppose if you're in the humanities, the equivalent is pestering people at the espresso bar...
