One of my favorite art bloggers, Katherine Tyrell, has <a href="http://makingamark.blogspot.com/2009/10/exhibition-review-art-of-plant.html">an illustrated review of a Kew Gardens exhibition, titled "The Art of Plant Evolution"</a>. 

<blockquote>It manages to neatly combine art and science by displaying botanical paintings in the latest evolutionary sequence revealed by recent DNA analysis.</blockquote>

There are lots of fungi in there masquerading as plants (I suppose they're under Kew's purview as well).
