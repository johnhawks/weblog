In <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/testing/gene-testing-marketing-2009.html">my post the other day</a>, I raised the idea that direct-to-consumer genetic testing is a media business. That post has gotten some reactions (<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/04/genome_the_satellite_channel.php">Genetic Future</a>, <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/do-you-want-to-know-sequence-of-your.html">Sandwalk</a>) and has generated some e-mail from readers. 


I assume that neither SNP genotyping nor whole-genome resequencing is going to generate medically useful data for <i>most</i> people over the short term. We haven't been finding many common risk alleles, and the ones we've found don't explain much of the variation in health outcomes. I tend to think they won't be very medically useful over the long term, either, which I think helps the direct-to-consumer market. <b>If genotyping or resequencing were suddenly routinely covered by health plans, <i>and</i> if open-records-favorable regulations were adopted, direct-to-consumer testing would be near-irrelevant</b>. 

I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/testing/obama-health-genetics-policy-2008.html">reflected on the issue of government involvement in genetics earlier this year</a>, after some press reports about then-Senator Obama's legislative involvement. I wrote:

<blockquote>Direct-to-consumer gene testing companies presently differentiate themselves based on the different information they provide to their customers. That approach works as long as there is little of value in the results -- the companies today are succeeding or failing on the basis of the communities of customers they are building, with the stories of customers providing the best advertisements. That's the nutrition supplement market.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...If the government becomes the health care purchaser -- and with Medicare it already is the largest -- we can expect to see early federal intervention in this market, focused upon standardizing genetic information provided to physicians.</blockquote>

If reporting of genetic test results were standardized, then <i>anyone</i> could write their own software to present the data. There's not much margin in that. On the health care side of the reporting, medical records companies have a huge advantage in deployment and compliance with federal regulations. On the individual side, there will be open-source offerings from universities or independent research groups undercutting any paid or subscription services. 

That leaves direct-to-consumer genetics as a media enterprise. That's probably a good thing in the long run, as companies won't be able to wring much profit out of genotyping for very many years. Instead, they need to find ways to sell information about genotypes (or sequences) that have already been shipped to customers. "Personalized medicine" may not be realistic, but "personalized news" already is.
