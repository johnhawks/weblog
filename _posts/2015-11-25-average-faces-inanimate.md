From Ethan Siegel: I'm weirdly fascinated by the ghostly image of a human face that emerges after averaging dozens of inanimate objects: <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/averaging-inanimate-objects-can-produce-human-faces-1a80cd1448d8#.iz6chssho">"Averaging Inanimate Objects Can Produce Human Faces"</a>.

The trick is that objects around us, from parking meters to tractors, have been designed with face-like symmetry. 

It does make you wonder, though, whether there is reality beneath all this work from evolutionary psychology about "average faces".
