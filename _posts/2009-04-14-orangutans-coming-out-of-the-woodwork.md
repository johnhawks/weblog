A reader forwarded <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-as-indonesia-new-orangutans,1,294710.story">this AP story about a new orangutan count</a> for a relatively unexplored corner of Borneo: 

<blockquote>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  Conservationists have discovered a new population of orangutans in a remote, mountainous corner of Indonesia  perhaps as many as 2,000  giving a rare boost to one of the world's most endangered great apes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A team surveying forests nestled between jagged, limestone cliffs on the eastern edge of Borneo island counted 219 orangutan nests, indicating a "substantial" number of the animals, said Erik Meijaard, a senior ecologist at the U.S.-based The Nature Conservancy.</blockquote>

The area is around a fifth the size of Yellowstone National Park in the U.S., so 2000 orangutans sounds like a pretty high density.
