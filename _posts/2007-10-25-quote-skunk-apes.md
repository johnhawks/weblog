My little girl, Sadie, couldn't sleep last night and we sat up watching a show about the "Skunk Ape" of the South. She loved it! Well, today I happened across <a href="http://metropulse.com/articles/2007/17_43/coverstory.html">an article</a> about skunk apes as an eastern Tennessee cultural phenomenon. Here's a quote:
</p>

<blockquote>The legend of Bigfoot, even as a symbol for a kind of unkempt redneck naturalism, can remind us of a simpler time, back when fantasy and reality had more of a symbiotic relationship. Back when tall tales had a tinge of morality woven into the yarn.</blockquote>
