A <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/niobrara/#continue">very interesting post</a> by <a href="http://pharyngula.org">Pharyngula</a> scribe P. Z. Myers that helps to put the geologic legacy of western Kansas into perspective. This is the part of the state I am from, and I have a painting of a Niobrara chalk outcrop on my living room wall. But there is nothing like considering the history of the area, with short mentions of the role of the <a href="http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/stern/stern.htm">Sternbergs</a> in discovering it, to put the landscape into a deeper perspective. This post goes from a microscopic view of the chalk to the paleontology of ancient reptiles in the formation.

You can find out more about them at the <a href="http://www.fhsu.edu/sternberg/">Sternberg Museum</a> in Hays, which preserves many of the original fossils prepared by George Sternberg. The web site could be better, but the museum is a real treat; it rivals some of the best university paleontology exhibit museums I have seen.

You can still find sharks' teeth on the chalk road past my grandparents' farm. They've been waiting 80 million years to be found.
