<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18454-hippie-apes-caught-cannibalising-their-young.html">Ewen Callaway in <i>New Scientist</i></a>: 

<blockquote>More individuals got a taste of the infant than is typical when the apes share meat. They also spent 7 hours eating the body  longer than they take over a similar-sized monkey. Some even played with it. "If they just think of it as another piece of meat, why do they behave differently with it?" he asks.</blockquote>

Of course you'll see a lot of rare things when you spend enough time watching. If the average individual can go through her entire life without eating the flesh of a conspecific, it's not probably very important. But seeing it rarely puts it in the range of behavior -- common enough in evolutionary timescales for either natural or cultural selection to pick it up if it were useful.
