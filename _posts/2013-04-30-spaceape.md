I've been moving rather slowly on writing up my reaction to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/apr/27/aquatic-ape-theory-primate-evolution">the <em>Observer</em> article on the high-profile aquatic ape theory symposium</a> that's soon to unwind in London, but this weekend there was a hilarious Twitter reaction to the news: evolution researchers and enthusiasts from all over the world began thinking of reasons why human traits are unique adaptations to a deep space environment. Kate Wong today writes up the story: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2013/04/30/space-ape-parody-shows-why-aquatic-ape-theory-is-all-wet/">"Space Ape Parody Shows Why Aquatic Ape Theory Is All Wet"</a>.

<blockquote>On April 27 the Guardian ran a story on the aquatic ape theory, highlighting a symposium that will be held in London May 8  9 to explore new research and evidence which suggests that at some stage during the last few million years, our human ancestors were exposed to a period of semiaquatic evolution which led to the acquisition of unique and primordial human characteristics. That story and other media coverage of the aquatic ape idea inspired anthropologist Brenna Hassett to propose a satirical alternative to the watery fringe theory in her blog the following day. Thus the space ape theory was born.</blockquote>

Hasset's post explaining the concept is here: <a href="http://passiminpassing.blogspot.com/2013/04/aquaticape-vs-spaceape-evolutionary.html">"#aquaticape vs #spaceape : evolutionary theory death match?"</a> The hashtag #spaceape is still going strong on Twitter, and maybe there will be some more creative ones. Let me just point out how much sense this makes of our very spherical heads!
