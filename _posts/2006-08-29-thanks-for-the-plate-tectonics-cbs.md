I've been seeing these ads for this new show, "Jericho", which is supposedly about how a western Kansas town reacts to some kind of nearby nuclear explosion. 
</p>

<p>
I've got to say, I'm <i>freaking</i> tired of seeing <i>mountains</i> in these ads that supposedly happen in <i>Kansas!</i>

<p>
Now, you know I'm <i>from</i> western Kansas, and this is looking to me like the worst kind of lunacy since Tom Clancy put a secret bioweapon lab outside of Salina, <i>complete with bus stop on I-70!</i>

<p>
Let's read <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/about/">a description</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>JERICHO is a drama about what happens when a nuclear mushroom cloud suddenly appears on the horizon, plunging the residents of a small, peaceful Kansas town into chaos, leaving them completely isolated and wondering if they're the only Americans left alive.</blockquote>

<p>
(Me: Sure, right. That's totally what would happen. Of course, it's hard to be <i>totally isolated</i> when there's nowhere more than a half-hour drive from anywhere else. Yeah, we're the <i>only Americans left alive</i> because the magic ju-ju bomb has whacked the whole country!
</p>

<p>
Gretchen: The whole <i>premise</i> is stupid! Do they think that Kansans are all some kind of rubes who disintegrate into some kind of science-fiction scenario as soon as something bad happens?!)
</p>

<p>
I just don't understand where the mountains are supposed to be. I mean, is this like somebody nukes Colorado Springs, and we're supposed to be able to <i>see</i> it from Kansas? Or did the nukes make the mountains? Have any of these people <i>been</i> to Kansas?
