Peanuts have an interesting origin: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/modern-peanut-s-wild-cousin-thought-extinct-found-in-andes/">"Modern Peanut's Wild Cousin, Thought Extinct, Found in Andes"</a>. 

<blockquote>The modern peanut (<em>Arachis hypogaea</em>) is the result of the hybridization of two older types of Andean peanut. It has 20 pairs of chromosomes—the total from both old species, which have 10 chromosomes each. Scientists always thought—a suspicion now confirmed—that the "parents" of this peanut were the variants <em>Arachis duranensis</em>, very common in the Andean foothills between northwestern Argentina and southeastern Bolivia, and <em>Arachis ipaensis</em>, a species that had been reported but unconfirmed in a Bolivian town several hundred kilometers north, but thought to be extinct, until now.</blockquote>
