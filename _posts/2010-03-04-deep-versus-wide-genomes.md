Remember <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/non-primate/genome-10k-hayden-2009.html">Genome 10K?</a> Well, here's <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/2/R16">a new study by Michel Milinkovitch and colleagues</a>, that points out the deficiencies of comparative data from 1X genomes: 

<blockquote><b>2 genomes - depth does matter</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Here, using recently-developed comparative genomic application systems, we evaluate the impact of low-coverage genomes on inferences pertaining to gene gains and losses when analyzing eukaryote genome evolution through gene duplication. We demonstrate that, when performing inference of genome content evolution, low-coverage genomes generate not only a massive number of false gene losses, but also striking artifacts in gene duplication inference, especially at the most recent common ancestor of low-coverage genomes. We show that the artifactual gains are caused by the low coverage of genome sequence per se rather than by the increased taxon sampling in a biased portion of the species tree.</blockquote>

They conclude that a diversity of 1X genomes may not be as useful as a smaller number of genomes at higher coverage. Wide coverage is good for testing conserved loci, but deep coverage will be necessary for many other kinds of comparisons.
