It's <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427395.700-2010-preview-arise-neanderthal-brother.html">a teeny little story by Ewen Calloway</a> at <I>New Scientist</i>, but they've given it the best headline: 

<blockquote><b>Arise, Neanderthal brother</b></blockquote>

Nothing new, though.
