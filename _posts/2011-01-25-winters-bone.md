Before anyone asks: Yes, I'm aware of <a href="http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/83/nominees.html">the Academy's unfortunate misspelling</a>.

UPDATE (2011-01-25): On the subject of John Hawkes, I just love this quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hawkes_(novelist)">John Hawkes the novelist</a>: 

<blockquote>"The writer should always serve as his own angleworm and the sharper the barb with which he fishes himself out of blackness, the better."</blockquote>
