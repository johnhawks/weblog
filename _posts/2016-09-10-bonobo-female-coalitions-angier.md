Nice article by Natalie Angier about recent work on bonobo social behavior: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/bonobos-apes-matriarchy.html">"Beware the Bonds of Female Bonobos"</a>. 

<blockquote>The latest research indicates that the nature of the bonobos’ sororal bonds shifts depending on circumstances, and that the most effective deterrent to male harassment may be a cross-generational pact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I sometimes think that bonobos sit up late at night reading papers about primates, and then decide to do the opposite,” said Joan Silk, a primatologist at Arizona State University. “They’re unusual in so many ways.”</blockquote>
