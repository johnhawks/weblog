Clearly the human non-furry skin phenotype is meant for <a href="http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2009/12/body-heat-power-source.html">more efficient heat transfer energy generation</a>: 

<blockquote>Vladimir Leonov and Ruud Vullers of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center have developed power supplies that can run off of your body heat. All you have to do is strap on the blingtastic headband you see here, and you're ready to go.</blockquote>

Your body dissipates anywhere between 60 and 140 watts of waste heat just from staying alive. Of course, evolution has crafted much of your body surface to minimize the heat gradient at the skin-air interface. But there are various warm bumps and nubbins that would allow the generation of several watts. One might imagine a next-generation iPhone with a heads-up display, powered by heat from your temples. 

The story discusses military applications, which I can't imagine working very well in many environments, since it's hard to capture energy from waste heat when the ambient temperature exceeds your body temperature.
