By the miracle of Amazon, I have been using my Kindle 3G to tweet from the Altai. It is far from an ideal blogging tool, so I will keep this to a short update. The device is perfectly matched to mobile Twitter, with free Whispernet coverage. I have to say I am really liking this device.

This morning I was tweeting live from inside the south gallery of Denisova Cave. At present I am bouncing in the back of a military surplus truck on the way to Okladnikov Cave. You can <a href="http://twitter.com/johnhawks">follow me on Twitter at @johnhawks</a>.
And let me say, constructing tha link on a chiclet keyboard with no symbols is more than I can take. So don't expect more blogging! I will keep tweeting for the duration.
