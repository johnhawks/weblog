I got to return to <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv">bloggingheads.tv</a> this week for Science Saturday, with a conversation between me and Christina Agapakis, of the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/oscillator/">Oscillator</a> blog.

Here's <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/28468?in=00:00&out=61:43">a non-embedded link to the diavlog</a>. Christina's work is in synthetic biology, and we talked a lot about the recent announcement from the J. Craig Venter Institute, with some background on what synthetic biology is, and how the newsmaking work fits into the field as a whole. I learned a lot from our conversation. We got to the Neandertal genome in the second half of our conversation, and we found several common links -- and neither of us mentioned synthetic Neandertals once!
