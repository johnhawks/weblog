Brian Switek reviews the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810984792/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0810984792"><em>Charles R. Knight: The Artist Who Saw Through Time</em></a>, by Richard Milner: <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2012/01/charles-r-knights-prehistoric-visions/">"Charles R. Knights Prehistoric Visions"</a>. 


<blockquote>Knights successes were hard-won, but, as Milners biography illustrates, the artist could not have done anything else. Knights undeniable passion was painting prehistory into life. A few snippets in the book provide some insights into Knights process. For dinosaurs, at least, Knight would often study the mounted skeletons of the animals and then, on the basis of this framework, create a sculpture. He could then study this three-dimensional representation for the play of shadow across the body under different conditions, and from this model Knight would then begin painting. </blockquote>
