I've had on my stack for quite a long time, a short paper by Nicholas van der Merwe and colleagues, assessing the stable carbon isotope ratios in several specimens from Tanzania. These include the <i>Homo habilis</i> specimens OH7, OH62 and OH65, and the <i>A. boisei</i> specimens OH5 and the Peninj mandible. 

The ratio of stable carbon-13 and carbon-12 enable an assessment of the amount of C<sub>4</sub> versus C<sub>3</sub> plants in the diet. I discussed the basic ideas in <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/early_hominids/diet/stable_isotopes_2005.html">a longer post from 2005</a>. 

The results on the <i>Homo</i> specimens are not too surprising. All three specimens overlap with South African <i>A. africanus</i>. OH7 and OH62 in particular have values around 20% C<sub>4</sub>, which is right near the mean observed for South African <i>Homo</i> and <i>A. robustus</i> from Swartkrans. OH65 has a higher C<sub>4</sub> percentage than the other two, but within the range observed for Sterkfontein Member 4 <i>A. africanus</i>, which was significantly higher than Makapansgat or the other South African samples. So it would appear that the diet of <i>Homo habilis</i> did not differ from earlier hominins in terms of the ultimate origin of carbon in grasses versus non-grass plants. 

What is more surprising is the extremely high amount of C<sub>4</sub>-derived carbon in OH5 and Peninj. They score 77% and 81% C<sub>4</sub>, respectively. These are the only two specimens of <i>A. boisei</i> for which these stable isotopes are known, and they are very far from the observed range in the South African <i>A. robustus</i>. 

The authors suggest an interesting source for this high C<sub>4</sub> proportion -- papyrus. They described a tasting tour of the wild plants of the Okavango: 


<blockquote>Bamford and van der Merwe investigated (and ate) the edible plants of the Okavango Delta in Botswana during the dry season (July 2003), assisted by Ezaya Karesaza, a tourist guide who grew up in this extensive wetland. Among the C<sub>3</sub> plants that are traditionally eaten raw in this region are a variety of fruits and seeds, as well as plants of which the leaves and rhizomes are eaten. The latter include <i>Aeschynomene fluitans</i>, a floating legumi- nous plant, of which the leaves taste like lettuce; <i>Typha capensis</i>, which grows in thick stands along the waters edge, of which the rhizomes have a pleasant taste; and <i>Schoenoplectus corymbosus</i>, a big water sedge, of which the stem is succulent at the bottom end. Among C<sub>4</sub> plants, the rhizomes and culms of three other species of sedges are edible. These include <i>Cyperus denudatus</i> and <i>C. dives</i>, which grow in the grasslands of the floodplains. Unlike the grasses, they are green year-round, although not particularly prolific. The most common C<sub>4</sub> sedge, by far, is <i>Cyperus papyrus</i>, which grows in dense thickets along the water edge. This species has culms as high as 4 m, of which the lowermost 0.5 m is frequently chewed by local people. It has a soft, white rind about 0.5 cm thick; the interior, about 2 to 3 cm in diameter, is more fibrous. It is chewy and pleasant tasting. The thick rhizome of papyrus is more fibrous and starchy than the culm, somewhat astringent, and requires considerable chewing effort. It produces a bolus in the mouth that has to be spat out at intervals.</blockquote>

They then reported the results of a nutritional analysis of the papyrus culm and rhizome, which have roughly the nutritional and caloric value of domestic potatos, although would require a significant gut flora to deal with the cellulosic content. 

All in all, it's very curious that <i>A. boisei</i> is so different in these isotopic values compared to other early hominins. The theme was picked up last year in a paper by Richard Wrangham and colleagues, who focused on the idea of "fallback foods" -- the kinds of foods that an animal does not prefer, but eats when other more highly preferred foods are not available. Considering the very high C<sub>4</sub> proportion indicated by the OH5 and Natron isotope values, it doesn't seem likely that this reflects a fallback strategy, but possibly an initial exploitation of such resources as fallbacks facilitated a later, more developed adaptation to them.
