This station has several casts of remains attributed to the species, <em>Australopithecus africanus</em>. This was the first australopithecine species discovered, and for many years was the earliest known species of hominids. In another station you can see the morphology of the pelvis of <em>A. africanus</em>. In this station, you'll see some crania and mandibles.


The fossils come from two sites in South Africa: <strong>Sterkfontein</strong>, which dates to around 2.6 million years ago, and <strong>Makapansgat</strong>, which is a bit older, around 2.8 million years old.



<strong>What to do:</strong> Take some time to become familiar with the fossils.

<ul>
<li>Several of them have teeth. Are they all adult or are some juveniles? </li>

<li>Seriate the dentitions in order from largest to smallest. What do you make of the differences in molar dimensions? </li>

<li>Look at the skulls from behind. How would you describe the shape of the outline of the skull from this view? </li>

</ul>
