Razib's post, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-paradigm-is-dead-long-live-the-paradigm/">"The paradigm is dead, long live the paradigm"</a>, is a personal remembrance of the modern human origins problem, from his perspective. It includes many kind words about me and some very nice application of Rachel Caspari and Milford Wolpoff's <i>Race and Human Evolution</i>. 

I'm out of town and the blog is mostly running on autopilot. I'll try to put up some more Denisova-related stuff this week but the real meaty analysis will have to wait until I''m back in the lab.
