Razib lists <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2010/02/culture_vs_genes_peoples_place.php">a taxonomy of culture-gene historical scenarios</a>. Real worked examples for several of these would be worthwhile. 

It's now several years since I've noticed a lot of interest in the project of correlating gene trees and language trees. That may be because human geneticists have reflected on the importance of geography -- which in most cases seems stronger than any culture-historical factor in explaining allele frequencies. Or maybe it's because nobody ever really understood the "synthetic map" approach. 

Most of the people interested in culture history accounts of migration have focused on Y and mtDNA haplotypes, but I think there's room for new work on SNP genotypes and population history. We need some better models of culture contact and demography, and we need to integrate selection with the models.
