The BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7591945.stm">a profile of forensic anthropologist Caroline Wilkinson</a>, which has a nice little review of some new computerized facial reconstruction techniques:

<blockquote>The first stage of virtual reconstruction mirrors the real process - the placement of pegs that indicate tissue depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When modelling by hand, wooden pegs have to be placed using a ruler and a scalpel - the computer is simpler and much more accurate but not faster.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have to follow the same rules and go through the same analysis, so it takes the same amount of time," said Dr Wilkinson.</blockquote>

...and the same number of billable hours! Just kidding, most of this is not legal work, and the computer does very little of the analytical part of the work; it just comes stocked with parts and allows more review of the work as it progresses.
