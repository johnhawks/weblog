Education professor Sam Wineburg has a provocative essay in the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> espousing a public impact agenda: <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/08/26/choosing-real-world-impact-over-impact-factor/">"Choosing Real-World Impact Over Impact Factor"</a>. He describes his increasing work getting curricular materials out to teachers free over the internet, and reflects on how little impact his research has actually had on the real world. 

<blockquote>Dont get me wrong. I have not given up on verified knowledge, scientific replication, peer review, and rigorous statistical tests. I still publish in specialized journals and help my graduate students do so. I serve on two editorial boards, attend academic conferences, and dutifully fill out the ballot for the officers of my professional association. Whats changed is that Ive stopped lying to myself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I no longer believe that the scholarly enterprise of education has much to do with educational betterment.</blockquote>

I think the word "impact" is a good touchstone for Wineburg's essay. Another could be "value". A program that has real-world impact is valuable to any university, but perversely not nearly so valuable to academic colleagues who decide promotions, tenure, and who review grants and publications.
