Well, it looks like the British Science Festival is going to be a whole lot stranger than the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2615">World Science Festival</a> was:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/sep/17/pope-astronomer-baptise-aliens">"Pope's astronomer says he would baptise an alien if it asked him"</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Speaking ahead of a talk at the British Science Festival in Birmingham tomorrow, he said that the traditional definition of a soul was to have intelligence, free will, freedom to love and freedom to make decisions. "Any entity  no matter how many tentacles it has  has a soul." Would he baptise an alien? "Only if they asked."</blockquote>

Oh, I can only hope that nobody asks me about Neandertals...
