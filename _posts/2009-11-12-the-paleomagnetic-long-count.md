A little off-topic, but interesting: Chris Rowan writes about <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/highlyallochthonous/2009/11/the_amazing_disappearing_asymm.php">paleomagnetic reversals and crustal movements</a> some billion years ago.

<blockquote>The change in inclinations through the section indicates that North America moved almost 30 degrees - around 3000 kilometres - southward in just 11 million years of volcanic activity. This means that the plate that it was located on was travelling at a speed somewhere between 20 and 40 centimetres a year, which is significantly faster even than India prior to its collision with Asia. Rather intriguingly, we may have replaced one geological mystery with another.</blockquote>
