<i>National Geographic News</i> has <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070702-tooth-europe.html">a short article</a> about the tooth from Sima del Elefante, Atapuerca. <br />
 
<blockquote>The team notes that the tooth's age, dated at around 1.2 million years old, is similar to that of stone tools and animal fossils bearing human-tool cut marks uncovered at sites in Spain, France, and Italy.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>"Now we finally have the anatomical evidence of the [early humans] that fabricated tools more than one million years ago," the team said in a statement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The researchers added that they are waiting for final analysis of the tooth before publishing their findings in a scientific journal.</blockquote>

Not much more to say, really.
