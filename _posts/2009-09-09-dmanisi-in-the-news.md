There are all kinds of stories in the British press today about Dmanisi. You'd think maybe this is because there's something new in <i>Nature</i> -- but no, they're all reporting on a talk given by David Lordkipanidze at the British Science Festival. (<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/09/did-early-humans-evolve-in-eur.html"><i>New Scientist</i>'s blog reports the talk</a>.) 

Cool stuff, but none of the accounts give any new informative details about the fossils.
