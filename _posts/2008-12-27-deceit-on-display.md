Natalie Angier <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/science/23angi.html?_r=1">enters a nice article</a> on deception in animals, focusing on primates. 

<blockquote>Great apes, for example, make great fakers. Frans B. M. de Waal, a professor at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory University, said chimpanzees or orangutans in captivity sometimes tried to lure human strangers over to their enclosure by holding out a piece of straw while putting on their friendliest face.</blockquote>

<blockquote>People think, Oh, he likes me, and they approach, Dr. de Waal said. And before you know it, the ape has grabbed their ankle and is closing in for the bite. Its a very dangerous situation.</blockquote>

Let's face it, you could get <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1548">much worse</a>.
