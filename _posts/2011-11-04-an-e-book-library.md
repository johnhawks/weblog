Libraries have gone into e-book lending in a big way recently, and now Amazon is getting into the act with its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&ref_=amb_link_357575542_1&docId=1000739811&ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Amazon Lending Library</a>. I've been watching e-books pretty closely, and this seems like an interesting development: get a Kindle and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/signup/books?ie=UTF8&redirectURL=L2dwL2ZlYXR1cmUuaHRtbA&redirectQueryParams=ZG9jSWQ9MTAwMDczOTgxMQ&ref=shortURL_kindleprime&ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Amazon Prime</a>, and borrow a book at a time for free -- sort of like Netflix for books. 

There are limits on which books. The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204621904577014273003626952.html"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> points out (subscription)</a> that none of the six largest publishers are participating. I'd be interested to know what kind of consideration Amazon gives to publishers for allowing their e-books to be lent, and what impact it has on the rankings of those books in the Amazon store.
