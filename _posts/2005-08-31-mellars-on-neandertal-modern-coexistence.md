Reuters is <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2005-08-31T170128Z_01_HAR161307_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-NEANDERTHAL-DC.XML">reporting</a> on a study by Paul Mellars [UPDATE (8/31/05): Brad Gravina] and others concerning Neandertal-modern archaeological coexistence. Apparently, they have documented the interleaving of an Aurignacian level between two levels "attributed to Neanderthals". 
</p>

<p>
The report says that the study is in this week's <i>Nature</i>. It isn't. So, I'll post again when I can find the paper. 
</p>

<p>
It's not exactly clear to me what is new here. This is what Richard Klein wrote in 2003 (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/299/5612/1525?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&titleabstract=whither&searchid=1125519571140_9108&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=0&fdate=10/1/1995&tdate=8/31/2005">summary</a>) about the archaeological interleaving of "Neandertal" and "modern" archaeological remains: 
</p>

<blockquote>Evidence for cultural contact is also sparse, except for one well-documented case from central France. Here, a site occupied by Neanderthals shortly before their disappearance has provided an undeniable mix of Middle and Upper Paleolithic artifact types, including well-made bone tools and jewelry. It also contains the only indisputable house ruin from a Neanderthal site. </blockquote>

<p>
The current work refers to a different site, but the results are certainly not a surprise. Another case of Neandertal non-news news. 
</p>

<p>
And Reuters adds insult to injury by posting the story with a picture of a Chinese woman looking at a reconstruction of Peking Man!
</p>

<p>
Now, if they actually found a <i>modern human fossil</i> in association with their "modern human" "Aurignacian" tools, that would be news!
</p>

<p>
UPDATE: A reader has kindly sent me the complete paper, discussed in <a href="weblog/reviews/neandertals/gravina_chatelperron_2005.html">a later post</a>. Apologies to study author Brad Gravina, since my initial post followed <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2005-08-31T170128Z_01_HAR161307_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-NEANDERTHAL-DC.XML">Reuters</a> in giving primary credit for the Chatelperron research to Paul Mellars; Mellars is a coauthor of the study.
