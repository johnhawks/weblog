An <a href="http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2010/10/05/from-e-books-to-no-books/">article about the future bookless libraries</a>, which may already be springing up at a campus near you: 

<blockquote>Last month, the University of Texas at San Antonio announced it had built the worlds first bookless library. Its Applied Engineering and Technology Library offers access to 425,000 e-books and 18,000 e-journal subscriptions, and librarians say theyve yet to hear a complaint from the 350-plus students and faculty who pass through its doors daily. Weve gotten no negative feedback, says Krisellen Maloney, library dean at the University of Texas. We looked at circulation rates, we looked at electronic resources, we looked at requests, and we decided that having the services was more important than the physical books. She adds bluntly: When we prioritized the needs, the books werent the priority.</blockquote>

That can't be good for the academic book market.
