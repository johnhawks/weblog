This is sort of sad: National Geographic News' <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091207-top-ten-archaeology-finds-2009.html">"Top Ten Archaeology" stories of 2009</a>. The top four all involve buried treasure of some kind. 

Oh, and one of them involves vampires. 

UPDATE (2009-01-05): A reader writes to suggest I tell everybody these are the top ten by views, not by editor choices. I had hoped that would be apparent to those who read the list; that's the main reason I find it sad!
