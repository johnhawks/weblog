Jennifer Viegas <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29492764/">writes about historical research</a> into Darwin's home life and the role of Emma Darwin's music in Darwin's career. 

<blockquote>In "The Descent of Man," Darwin wrote, "I conclude that musical notes and rhythm were first acquired by the male or female progenitors of mankind for the sake of charming the opposite sex."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Derry added, "Darwin's idea was that the organs for sound production in early humans could have been precursory to more complex verbal communication, namely language."</blockquote>

The article throws in a few unrelated things, too, but it's interesting to read.
