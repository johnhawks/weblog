Re: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2505">"The simple foods"</a>: 

<blockquote>Thanks for the pointer to this irritating James McWilliams piece.  I hate it when huge amounts of rhetoric blow up around a piece that is so logically flawed, so this is short. 
 
Mr. McWilliams fails to distinguish between romanticizing the past and choosing not to poison oneself. He is actually suggesting that people in 1870 would have been stupid to object to sawdust in their food.</blockquote>

Yeah, like that fool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a>, just pining away for a more innocent age.
