Thomas Henry Huxley, in <i>Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</i>:

<blockquote>If I have abstained from quoting M. Du Chaillu's work, then, it is not because I discern any inherent improbability in his assertions respecting the man-like Apes; nor from any wish to throw suspicion on his veracity; but because, in my opinion, so long as his narrative remains in its present state of unexplained and apparently inexplicable confusion, it has no claim to original authority respecting any subject whatsoever. </blockquote>

<blockquote>It may be truth, but it is not evidence.</blockquote>

Bulldog, indeed.
