<i>A propos</i> to my <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/teaching/dump-bronte-for-muir-thoreau-2008.html">post earlier this week about reading science in English class</a>, Olivia Judson devotes her weekly blog entry to the question, <a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/an-original-confession/">"Was Darwin a good science writer?"</a> No surprise, she thinks he was, despite certain dense sections, of the <i>Origin</i>. 

Judson describes the confessionals of professional biologists who never read the founding work of evolutionary biology. I'm less concerned: Much of the <i>Origin</i> is hard to read, and many biology students would be better served reading a modern exegesis. I would be more interested in seeing students read a good selection of excerpts of Darwin's other works, especially the <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>, and I'd like to see letter exchanges included as examples of scientific and literary correspondence. 

Don't get me wrong: Both the <i>Origin</i> and the <i>Descent of Man</i> (both freely available from <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin Online</a>) reward close reading. As do many other dense works, including Fisher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198504403?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0198504403"><i>Genetical Theory</i></a> and Lotka's <i>Elements of Physical Biology</i>. But they're college-level works, no doubt, and not everyone's cup of tea.
