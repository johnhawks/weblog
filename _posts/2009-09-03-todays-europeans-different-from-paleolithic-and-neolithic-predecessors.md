<a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/central-european-farmers-not-descended.html">Dienekes</a>, on <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1176869">a new study</a> of early Neolithic and earlier mtDNA variation in Europe:

<blockquote>This study is also a powerful argument against the idea of genetic continuity across long time spans. Most ancient DNA studies so far have reached a similar conclusion. Thus, it also destroys the supposed justification for continuity from Paleolithic Europe to modern times that early mtDNA work (of the Daughters of Eve variety) has proposed, hand in hand with the hunter acculturation hypothesis.</blockquote>

I'll be reading the study carefully and commenting this weekend.
