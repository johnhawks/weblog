Edmund Blair Bolles has been <a href="http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/evolang-2010/">reporting on the Evolang 2010 conference</a>. The conference is a meeting of people interested in the biological origins of language, and happened in Utrecht last week. I was really sorry that this ran against the AAPA meetings, as I really would like to have gone. At any rate, I was a reviewer for some of the proposed presentations and hope that I will make it next time around.
