The pelvis is a complex made of three bones: the <strong>sacrum</strong> and the left and right <strong><em>os coxae</em></strong>, also called "innominate" bones. The sacrum forms the posterior part of the pelvis, and is made up of fused vertebrae. Many primates have a tail extending from the end of the sacrum; humans and apes have only a small number of tiny vertebral bodies, called the <strong>coccyx</strong>, or ``tailbone.''  


The innominate bones (<em>os coxae</em>) make up the sides and the front of the pelvis. Each innominate bone is itself composed of three fused bones: 

<dl>
<dt>Ilium</dt><dd>The largest part of the innominate bone, this forms the upper blade, which flares outward to make a bowl-shaped cavity supporting the abdominal organs.</dd>
<dt>Ischium</dt><dd>The ischium is the most inferior part of the pelvis, the part that most primates sit on.</dd>
<dt>Pubis</dt><dd>The pubis is in the front of the pelvis. The two pubes meet at the midline at the <strong>pubic symphysis</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

The three bones meet in the center of the socket for the hip joint, called the <strong>acetabulum</strong>. The bones fuse together during childhood, so that adults do not have any marking showing the boundaries between them. 


A few other features of the innominate bones give important information about sex or locomotion. 


<strong>What to do:</strong> Take some time to orient yourself on the pelves at this station. Be sure to be able to identify the acetabulum, pubic symphysis, and the sacrum, ilium, ischium and pubis.
