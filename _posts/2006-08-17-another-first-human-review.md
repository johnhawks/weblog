David Begun <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1130116">reviews Ann Gibbons' <I>The First Human</i></a> in <i>Science</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Gibbons profiles in some detail a dozen among the hundreds of past and present paleoanthropologists. In an even-handed manner, she presents both sides of each conflict, a few cases of which are highly acrimonious, if not borderline criminal, in nature. Some would say she is in places a bit too kind, but that is for the reader to judge. Paleoanthropologists will understand that the conflicts and dubious activities the author describes are not typical of their field, and other scientists will recognize that their own ponds have a film of prima donnas sometimes behaving badly that rises to the surface and comes to the attention of outsiders. </blockquote>
