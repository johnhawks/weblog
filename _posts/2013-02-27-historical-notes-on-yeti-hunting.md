From <em>Slate</em>, a memo outlining <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/02/26/search_for_yeti_the_foreign_service_memo_advising_yeti_hunters.html">"The American Government's Advice for Yeti Hunters, 1959"</a>.

<blockquote>The memo came at the end of a decade of strenuous Yeti-hunting. This Outside Magazine timeline of Yeti hunts tells the story in compact form. In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Everest, and reported seeing large tracks. In 1954, the Daily Mail (UK) funded a sixteen-week Snowman Expedition to Everest to look for clues. (The newspaper is still on the case today.) And in the late 1950s, American oil millionaire and cryptozoology enthusiast Tom Slickwhose colorful life, as Badass Digest points out, should definitely be made into a moviebankrolled a number of Himalayan expeditions in search of the creature.</blockquote>
