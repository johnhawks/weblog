I'm coming late to this story, but it's still timely! The <i>New York Times</i> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/12/opinion/12wynne.html">an op-ed by Clive Wynne</a> linking the inspiration for the original <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9a2luZyBrb25nfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=31;fm=1"><i>King Kong</i></a> to Soviet attempts to breed a chimpanzee-human hybrid: 
</p>

<blockquote>The young Soviet Union, in its effort to stamp out religion, was determined to prove that men were descended from apes. In 1926, a Soviet scientist named Ilya Ivanov decided the most compelling way to do this would be to breed a humanzee: a human-chimpanzee hybrid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ivanov set off for a French research station in West Africa. There he inseminated three female chimpanzees with human sperm. Not his own, for he shared the colonial-era belief that the local people were more closely related to apes than he was. He stayed long enough to learn that his experiment had failed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Next Ivanov wrote a Cuban heiress, Rosalia Abreu. Abreu was the first person to breed chimps in captivity and had a large menagerie outside Havana. Ivanov asked if any of her male chimpanzees might be available to inseminate a Russian volunteer known to posterity only as 'G."</blockquote>

The link to <i>King Kong</i> is not all that convincing, but the story of how this Soviet science project was ultimately stalled by the Ku Klux Klan is a good read.

I found the story via <a href="http://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/12/hooray-for-humanzee.html">Evolgen</a>, which has further thoughts about human-chimpanzee hybridization and chromosome number incompatibility. Evolgen got the story from John Wilkins' <a href="http://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2005/12/kong-love-interest.html">Evolving Thoughts</a>, which has further thoughts as concerns hybridization in the development of nineteenth-century biology. All well worth a read, especially since they are free supplements to the movie!

Now, if someone could explain to me why there is a single giant gorilla on this island of dinosaurs? 
</p>

<p>
Or better, why the gorilla isn't a dwarf? I can understand about the dinosaurs -- after all, reptiles get bigger on islands, right?
