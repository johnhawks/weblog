A team from the Museum of Natural Science in Houston spent four years negotiating the U.S. tour, which will start in Houston next September.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The six-year tour will also go to Washington, New York, Denver and Chicago. Officials said six other U.S. cities may be on the tour, but would not release the names, saying all the details had not been ironed out.</blockquote>
