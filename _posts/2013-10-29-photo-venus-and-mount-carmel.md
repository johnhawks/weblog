Tonight I had the pleasure of attending the official event recognizing the creation of the <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1393">"Sites of Human Evolution at Mount Carmel" UNESCO World Heritage Site.</a> This includes the famous caves of Skhul and Tabun, as well as the neighboring Jamal and El Wad caves, which together represent some 400,000 years of evolutionary and cultural history. 

The event had some industrial-scale lighting, which gave me the chance for this photo of the end of the Wadi Mughara (Nahal Me'arat) with Venus:

Tabun Cave is in the darkened recess of the rock visible in the photo.
