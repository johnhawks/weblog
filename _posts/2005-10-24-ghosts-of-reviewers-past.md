Googling something else entirely brought me <a href="http://www.bio.indiana.edu/%7ebrodielab/index.html">this page</a> by Edmund D. Brodie III, chronicling a few of the comments from manuscript reviews he's received over the years.

<p>
Personally I'd need a lot more self-confidence than I have to put that kind of stuff out there. Or maybe I'm just not far enough away yet to laugh about it. (<i>Who am I kidding? Alpha Centauri wouldn't be far enough away.</i>)

It illustrates very well why I always try to be as careful in my reviews as I am in my papers.
