Charles Stross: <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/10/how_habitable_is_the_earth.html">"How habitable is the Earth?"</a>

<blockquote>The point is this: <b>we are finely tuned survival machines that have evolved to survive in a niche on one particular planet in one particular epoch</b>. Even our <b>own</b> planet is unimaginably hostile to our kind of life for most of its history. And while survival outside that niche is possible with the assistance of a horrendously complex toolkit we call "civilization", we've yet to try it somewhere where we can't count on the basics (free oxygen and triple point water). </blockquote>
