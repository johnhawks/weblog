Anthropologist Barbara J. King has <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2011/09/15/140461011/humans-and-other-animals-a-voice-from-anthropology">begun a stint as a writer at the NPR science and culture blog, 13.7</a>. In her introductory post, she gives a pr&egrave;cis of the field for the readers:

<blockquote>Anthropology asks some big questions about how this state of affairs emerged. How did <em>Homo sapiens</em> come to be the primate for whom social meaning-making is as natural as bipedal striding, technology making and communicating through endlessly inventive words and gestures? In what ways do we overlap with, and in what ways do we diverge from, other primates in this regard, indeed from other animals generally? How has our evolutionary journey been shaped by our interactions with the other animals who share our habitats, and who  in many cases  approach their lives as thinking, feeling beings in their own right?</blockquote>
