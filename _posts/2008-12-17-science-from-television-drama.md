<i>Wired</i> has a story about <a href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/12/science-fact-fa.html">the trend toward more television dramas with science content.</a> Some may disagree that a show like <i>CSI</i> is especially science-related; notwithstanding the shots where a camera is being jammed up into a corpse orifice. But it seems obvious that the current crop of TV dramas uses science, like forensics, psychology, even <i>math</i> for goodness' sake, in a way that would have been unimaginable in the days of <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> and <i>Crazy Like A Fox</i>. 

Writer Hugh Hart attributes the trend to Michael Crichton:

<blockquote>Why is real science so hot on prime time? Some of the credit goes to the late Michael Crichton.  Ever since he introduced clinically correct doctor-speak to the airwaves with medical drama ER, story lines on science-heavy television shows have been bumping up references to astrophysics, neurobiology, quantum mechanics and other topics ripped from the headlines of obscure scholarly publications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The geek-friendly ER, which wraps its 15-year run in May, launched a spawn of pop culture/propellerhead crossovers that engage TV viewers' brainwaves even as they're being entertained by age-old soap-opera machinations. For an increasingly tech-savvy generation of couch potatoes, factually flimsy plot details simply don't pass muster.</blockquote>

Well, I don't remember anything obvious pre-<i>ER</i> that presaged the trend. Definitely not <i>Diagnosis: Murder</i> territory. Maybe initially this was just the small-screen translation of Crichton's science fiction movie successes. 

Now some of the new science-y shows are just excuses for nerd humor -- witness, <i>Big Bang Theory</i>. And many of these shows, including some of my favorites, like <i>House</i> and <i>Numb3rs</i>, are ultimately driven by characters who are brilliant scientists themselves but have trouble relating to a group of more ordinary mortals. So there's the old unapproachable genius stereotype, where the genius has become the central character. 

Unless you're Lady Heather. 

But hey, at least the scientist <i>has</i> become the central character of these shows. It used to be that the scientist was some nebbishy middle-aged dude rescued by the hunky thirty-year-old hero. Now we haven't quite reached <i>Doc Savage</i> territory, but we're definitely moving up.
