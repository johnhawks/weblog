From the "AntiCraft": <a href="http://theanticraft.com/archive/beltane08/porkprincess.htm">instructions for making the ultimate bacon tiara</a>: 

<blockquote>You are going to be working with an enzyme that bonds protein. <b>You are made of protein.</b> Unless you want to glue your lungs together or glue your eyelids to your eyeballs, you absolutely must follow these safety rules. We cannot be held accountable for any mishaps you might have while working with transglutaminase.</blockquote>
