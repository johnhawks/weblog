This is that Superbowl time of year when everybody's thinking about advertising, so I thought it appropriate to point to <a href="http://ronrosenbaum.pajamasmedia.com/2007/01/26/the_geico_caveman_finally_jump.php">this post</a> (Ron Rosenbaum) about those Geico commercials with the cavemen. 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Roast duck with mango salsa.</b> I never got tired of the delivery of that line.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But then they topped it with the Fox cable parody, where the faux-tough announcer who filled half the screen said "Face it you guys have had some trouble evolving". And the caveman in the upper right quadrant delivers another iconic rejoinder with exasperated fashion-intern snark: "You know I'm not a hundred per cent in love with your tone." In a tone that's a hundred per cent in love with its own sarcasm. Followed by, "Yeah, walking upright, discovering fire, inventing the wheel creating the foundation of civilization - sorry we couldn't get that to you sooner."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Genius!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Following which, in the lower quadrant, we get the Liz Cheny [sic] type tartly observing, "Sounds like somebody got up on the wrong side of the rock."</blockquote>

<p>
Rosenbaum is less impressed by the current ad, where the caveman is talking to his therapist. Personally, that one always cracks me up -- first, because the therapist is played by <I>Rocky</i>'s Adrian, Talia Shire; and second, because you can see the look of realization in her face at that moment just before the caveman says, "What? Stupid?"

Maybe the print ad does take it a little far, though: 
</p>

<div class="pic">

<p>
Still, the whole caveman ad campaign has this great sensibility that seems just right for Neandertals. Even the Neanderphiles patronize them!
