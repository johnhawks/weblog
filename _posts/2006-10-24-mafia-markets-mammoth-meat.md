Has the Hwang Woo-suk scandal <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15399222/">jumped the shark?</a>

<blockquote>"Some of the money was spent in contacting the Russia mafia as we tried to clone mammoths," Hwang told the court during a hearing on Tuesday. "But you can't say that (on the expense claim) so we expensed it as money for cows for experiment."</blockquote>

<p>
What, there's really no blank for "mafia mammoth contacts?" What kind of show are they running? 
</p>

<p>
And can you imagine one morning at the Russian mafia call center? Sir, the North Koreans are on line 1 asking for plutonium. Oh, and the South Koreans are on line 2 asking for some frozen mammoth ovaries.
</p>

<p>
And how hard is it to get animal ovaries, anyway? 
</p>

<blockquote>Hwang denied any of the funds were used for anything other than research. He described extra expenses incurred when trying to secure animal ovaries in addition to paying for junior researchers' housing and travel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Do you know how hard it is to secure four or five animal ovaries at butcher shops? You need to keep the workers there happy."</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, well then. Never mind.
