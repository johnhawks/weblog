Owen Lovejoy, quoted in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.319.5870.1599">an Ann Gibbons news piece</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>To resolve this debate [about the style of early hominid bipedalism], says anatomist Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University in Ohio, researchers should also look at the pelvis, back, foot, and ankle of other early hominins, still under analysis.</blockquote>
