From the <a href="http://www.popsci.com/archive"><i>Popular Science</i> archive</a>, June 1963 (p. 24):

<blockquote><b>Too much specialization?</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Man--like the giraffe--may have stuck his neck out too far, says British anthropologist Louis S. B. Leakey. The threat is extinction. </blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leakey contends that man's hands and brains are also instruments of overspecialization--creating the tools of self-destruction. But he adds that one specialized trait--intelligence--could also save him.</blockquote>
