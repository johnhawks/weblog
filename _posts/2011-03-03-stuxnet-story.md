Fascinating detective story in <i>Vanity Fair</i> about <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104?printable=true">how computer security researchers ferreted out the workings of the Stuxnet worm</a>. I especially enjoyed the psychological sketch of one of the main figures in the story, who works in industrial control software: 

<blockquote>If I did not have the background that I had, I dont think I would have had the guts to say what I said about Stuxnet, Langner says now, finishing his second glass of wine during lunch at a Viennese restaurant in Hamburg. Langner studied psychology and artificial intelligence at the Free University of Berlin. He fell into control systems by accident and found that he loved the fiendishly painstaking work. Every control system is like a bespoke suit made from one-of-a-kind custom fabrictailored precisely for the conditions of that industrial installation and no other. In a profession whose members have a reputation for being unable to wear matching socks, Langner is a bona fide dandy. My preference is for Dolce & Gabbana shoes, he says. Did you notice, yesterday I wore ostrich? Langner loves the attention that his theories have gotten. He is waiting, he says, for an American chick, preferably a blonde, and preferably from California, to notice his blog and ask him out.</blockquote>
