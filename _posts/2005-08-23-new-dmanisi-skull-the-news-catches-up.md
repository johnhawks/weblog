The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9045004/">story of the new Dmanisi skull</a> hit the American news today. Nothing new compared to <a href="weblog/fossils/lower/dmanisi/dmanisi_discovery_2005.html">my post of two weeks ago</a>, based on reports in the Georgian press. 
</p>

<p>
I guess the AP held the press release until a slow news cycle. Which may have been justified -- no new details, no pictures, no news, right? But it seems to me that there are a few really active science reporters that write stories with background, and beyond that there is a lot of science-reporting-by-press-release.

<p>
So I guess in this little corner of science, you'll continue to get the story -- with background -- here before anywhere else.
