They held a contest for schoolchildren to give a nickname to the new <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/sediba/malapa-berger-description-2010.html">MH 1 skeleton</a>, and now they've <a href="http://technology.iafrica.com/news/science/2450340.htm">made a choice:</a>

<blockquote>The juvenile hominid skeleton (Australopithecus sediba) unveiled to the world by Wits Professor Lee Berger, just over a month ago, has been given a new name: Karabo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Karabo means 'answer' in Setswana. The name was submitted by 17-year-old Omphemetse Keepile, a student at St. Mary's School in Waverly, Johannesburg.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Keepile says that she came up with the name 'Karabo' because 'it suggests that answers are present [and] that more answers will follow'.</blockquote>

Vastly better than most.
