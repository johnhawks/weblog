Barbara King asks, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/12/07/504650215/were-neanderthals-religious">"Were Neanderthals religious?"</a>

<blockquote>Given their intelligence, it seems to me likely that the Neanderthals contemplated, in some way, the mysteries of life. Wouldn't they have wondered not only about unexpected and surprising weather events and sky events but also what happens when our lives comes to an end? If they thought about these questions, did they do so with awe, dread or reverence?</blockquote>

I provided a quote for the piece, which discusses what kinds of evidence archaeologists consider. I have come to recognize that the recognition of mortality and cultural practices associated with death may be among the deepest behavioral aspects of human evolutionary history.
