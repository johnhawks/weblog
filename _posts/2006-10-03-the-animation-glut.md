Can I just say, <a href="times.com/2006/10/03/business/media/03animation.html"><i>"Yes, yes, YES!"</i></a>?
</p>

<blockquote>With more than a dozen computer-animated movies being readied for release by next summer, Hollywood is facing viewer fatigue worthy of Sleeping Beauty. Analysts and industry executives have long warned of a coming glut of computer-animated movies. That time has come.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, with so many movies for audiences to choose from, some are failing to meet expectations or are flopping outright.</blockquote>

<p>
As someone with four kids, I should say that <i>I am their market!</i> And their movies are mostly <i>BO-RING</i>, or sophomoric, or some combination of the two. 
</p>

<p>
Now, sure, every movie can't be <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/castle/"><i>Howl's Moving Castle</i></a>, but it seems to me that if they are spending $150 million to make a movie, they can <i>pay for a better script</i> than "Open Season". And it's a terrible use of computer animation just to recycle "Looney Tunes" visual gags -- heck, the reason why Pixar movies are usually the most visually interesting is that each of them has an original metaphor of movement and form. Again, if you are going to spend $150 million, we should get something better than the endless trains of Don Bluth mice from the 70's and 80's!

Can we have some <i>plot</i>, please:
</p>

<blockquote>Natalie Ward, 13, who was out shopping with her grandmother, Bonnie Ward, in Hollywood recently, was unimpressed with the latest offerings. "There are so many movies with animals," she said, pursing lips tinged blue by the icy neon drink in her hand. "The ones about cows are too, like, I don't know -- boring."</blockquote>

<p>
They all have the same insipid messages. "It's OK to be different." "It takes courage to be kind to others." "You can't succeed if you're selfish." Yada yada yada. Where's the adventure? This stuff just kills the imagination. 
</p>

<p>
And don't get me started on the "Land Before Time". BLEEAGGH! Gretchen worked in a natural history museum when the Disney dinosaur movie came out, and the kids wanted to know where all the dinosaurs with the <i>fake Disney names</i> were! You might as well send them to a farm to find the <i>talking cows!</i>

<p>
(OK, that ends today's rant. We now return to our normal broadcasting...)
