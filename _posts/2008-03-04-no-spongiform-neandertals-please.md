Julien Riel-Salvatore <a href="http://averyremoteperiodindeed.blogspot.com/2008/03/mad-neanderthal-disease.html">reviews some reasons</a> why kuru did not wipe out the Neandertals. 
</p>

<p>
I don't have anything to add. The hypothesis comes from a paper in <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> by Simon Underdown; here's part of the abstract: 
</p>

<blockquote>TSEs could have infected Neanderthal groups as a result of general cannibalistic activity and brain tissue consumption in particular. Further infection could then have taken place through continued cannibalistic activity or via shared used of infected stone tools. A modern human hunter-gatherer proxy has been developed and applied as a hypothetical model to the Neanderthals. This hypothesis suggests that the impact of TSEs on the Neanderthals could have been dramatic and have played a large part in contributing to the processes of Neanderthal extinction.</blockquote>

<p>
The short paper is admittedly speculative but quite clear. It does fail to cite the literature about selection on the prion gene, <i>PRNP</i> (I discussed it <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/brain/prion_ascertainment_soldevilla_2006.html">here in early 2006</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Riel-Salvatore points out all the reasons why it is probably wrong: 
</p>

<p>
1. Neandertals were eating each other 100,000 years before they went away. 
</p>

<p>
2. Neandertals didn't live as long as most humans who develop TSE symptoms.
</p>

<p>
3. Neandertals lived at much lower densities than the Kuru-spreading Fore people, and it's not credible for them to have spread a prion disease by cannibalism across this space (although, the urine-dispersed CWD seems to do spread pretty well through deer). 
</p>

<p>
4. Non-Neandertals have a clear record of altering human skeletal remains also, including African Middle Pleistocene and early Upper Paleolithic Europeans. 
</p>

<p>
I think these points are fatal to the hypothesis, unless we resort to a different mode of transmission; but in that case there is no reason to suppose that a prion disease would be involved rather than a viral or bacterial agent. I should also mention that despite early claims, there is not any reason now to think that the human prion gene was under long balancing selection.
