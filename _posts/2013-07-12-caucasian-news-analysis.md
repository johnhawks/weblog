Shaila Dewan, an "economics reporter" for the <em>New York Times</em> catches up with anthropology circa 1963: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/sunday-review/has-caucasian-lost-its-meaning.html">"Has Caucasian Lost Its Meaning?"</a>.

<blockquote>Susan Glisson, who as the executive director of the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation in Oxford, Miss., regularly witnesses Southerners sorting through their racial vocabulary, said she rarely hears Caucasian. Most of the folks who work in this field know that its a completely ridiculous term to assign to whites, she said. I think its a term of last resort for people who are really uncomfortable talking about race. They use the term thats going to make them be as distant from it as possible.</blockquote>

And thus we have come to the end of "all the news that's fit to print". This doesn't even have the usual <em>NYT</em> angle of hipster-acquaintances-of-the-columnist who have decided to adopt an otherwise-odd behavior. <em>Hey, world -- anthropology got it right fifty years ago! You can relax now!</em>
