We were in Hawaii last month and visited Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The park has an area with exceptional petroglyphs from early Hawaiians, accessible by a short hike. Here is a group of human figures. These are carved into a lava flow that occurred sometime between A.D. 1250-1400, and people returned to this site for generations to cut new petroglyphs.
