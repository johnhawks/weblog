<p>
Not exactly a metaphor, but certainly of questionable taste in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7379554.stm">this story titled, "'Sex Pest' Seal Attacks Penguin"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Marion Island is the only place in the world where Antarctic fur seals are known to hunt king penguins on land, so the idea that the fur seal was trying to eat the object of its attention made sense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But then we realised that the seal's intentions were rather more amorous."</blockquote>
