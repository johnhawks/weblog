<p>
It's time for another semester to begin, and I'm looking forward to meeting all my new students. My introductory course, Anthro 105, is meeting Monday morning, and it is likely to be the first class of the semester for many students. Of course, with another 6 inches of snow, I may be missing a few. 
</p>

<p>
My courses this semester are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="weblog/courses/anth_105/">Anthropology 105, Principles of Biological Anthropology</a></li>
<li><a href="weblog/courses/mind/">Anthropology 603, Seminar in Evolutionary Theory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm going to let this run onto the main page, which may be a bit unusual for regular readers who aren't used to reading much about my classes. A lot of the content over the next few months will be related to my seminar, so this is a bit of a heads-up.
