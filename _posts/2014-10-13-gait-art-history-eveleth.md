A clever article by Rose Eveleth for <em>The Atlantic</em> looks into a peculiar regularity in the history of art: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/nobody-knows-what-running-looks-like/381171/?single_page=true">"Nobody Knows What Running Looks Like"</a>. Eveleth reviews the findings of a recent paper by Julian Meltzer, which investigates representations of human gait throughout the history of art. 

Normal human gait has the arms swinging opposite the legs. A step forward with the right leg is accompanied by a swing forward with the left arm. This arm swing facilitates a counter-rotation of the trunk and overall conservation of energy, and is natural for most people as soon as they learn to walk. 

Strangely, most artists who depicted humans running or walking have gotten it backward: showing people swinging the same arm and leg forward, not opposites. Eveleth shows some great examples from ancient Egypt up to the present day. 

<blockquote>When it comes to art, it’s possible that rather than being an error, the awkward, one sided lurch forward is an artistic choice. In Egyptian art, for example, artists followed strict rules about the position of the head and body. But as art evolved, and as accuracy of form become more and more important, it’s hard to imagine why someone like Da Vinci or Donatello would intentionally draw a person running in such an inaccurate pose. And modern “how to draw” guides are certainly not intentionally teaching someone the wrong posture.</blockquote> 

A survey of people shows that they report this aspect of gait significantly worse than chance...

<blockquote>And when participants were asked to pose in mid-run, only 14 percent of them picked the pose that actually reflected running. The other 86 percent froze with the same sided arm and leg moving forward.</blockquote>

The investigation into this common error leads to some interesting conclusions about how we learn to move.
