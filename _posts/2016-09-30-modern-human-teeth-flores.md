Ewen Callaway reports on a talk at the European Society for Human Evolution meeting, presenting new human teeth from the ongoing Liang Bua archaeological work: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/human-remains-found-in-hobbit-cave-1.20656">"Human remains found in hobbit cave"</a>. The story is that these remains may document some of the earliest modern human presence in the cave, postdating the last occurrence of <em>H. floresiensis</em> and extinct mammalian fauna. But I am always skeptical about the idea we can clearly diagnose the taxonomic status of unknown hominins from a couple of teeth.

<blockquote>María Martinón-Torres, a palaeoanthropologist at University College London who attended the talk, thinks that the lower molar looks like those of <em>H. sapiens</em>, whereas the premolar seems a bit more primitive. To prove conclusively that the teeth are human, she would like to see comparisons with a wide range of remains from <em>H. sapiens</em> and also from <em>H. erectus</em> (which might have survived in Indonesia until around 50,000 years ago). “I think they have quite a tough job. There are lot of factors to take into account,” she says.</blockquote>

It's very encouraging that the cave still holds much more evidence to uncover, and I'm sure we'll hear more as the work progresses.
