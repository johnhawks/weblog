Probably the most common thing for fellow researchers to ask me about my blog is, "How do you have time?"

In a new post, the Drugmonkey <a href="https://drugmonkey.scientopia.org/2020/04/20/reading-the-literature-and-writing/">"Reading the literature and writing"</a>

<blockquote>I think a lot of scientists really don’t like to read deeply into the literature. At best, perhaps they weren’t ever <em>trained</em> to read deeply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>So I’m not talking about reading the literature in a “keep up with the latest TOCs for all the relevant journals” kind of way. I’m talking about focused reading when you want to answer a question for yourself and to put it into some sort of scholarly setting, like a Discussion.</blockquote>

For me, blogging is part of how I engage with the literature in my field. I take notes, I cite sources, and I look into the way that people have developed their ideas. When it makes sense, I share that with others. And I am much more likely to think deeply when I am thinking about how to convey something for other people.

I do get the feeling that this kind of deep reading and engagement is actually quite rare, and that many researchers have a more tactical approach to reading. "Tactical" just means that people try to maximize their short-term benefits from reading and writing. I think it's better to be strategic in professional reading, and sometimes that means reading with deep engagement.
