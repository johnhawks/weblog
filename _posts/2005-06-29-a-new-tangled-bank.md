<p>
If you haven't seen it before, the <a href="http://www.tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank</a> is a science carnival -- a compilation of weblog posts on science and medicine from some of the best online authors. 
</p>

<p>
It rotates every issue to a different host, and <a href="http://science_boy.blogspot.com/2005/06/31st-meeting-of-tangled-bank-society.html">the current issue</a> is a good one. It has <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/forth_2005_ebu_gogo.html">one of my posts</a> and many others that I am working through myself. Go check it out and see the range of science writing on the web!
