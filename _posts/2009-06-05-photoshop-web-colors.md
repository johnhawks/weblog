This is off the usual topics, but I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1932">mentioned once</a> how poorly colors were coming out when I save sketchbook pieces as JPG. They look great in Photoshop, but saving as JPG mysteriously dulls all the colors. For the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2002">Termineander</a>, I overcorrected the colors and got acceptable results. 

But I wanted to point to a post on Viget Inspire, <a href="http://www.viget.com/inspire/the-mysterious-save-for-web-color-shift/">The Mysterious Save For Web Color Shift</a>. As with all things art, many people have noticed the problem ahead of me. The simplest solution is to set draft view to "Monitor RGB" (the lowest common denominator for the web) and forget the wonderful saturated colors that Photoshop managed to automatically get out of your scans. Sigh.
