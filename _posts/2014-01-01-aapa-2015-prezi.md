My presentation for the 2015 AAPA meeting, "Outreach and Education Components of the Rising Star Expedition", is an online resource. The Prezi includes some explanatory text describing the expedition and its outreach resources. In addition, the Prezi includes links to some of the project videos on YouTube.

I see this outreach and education symposium as a valuable way to share knowledge with other professional anthropologists and educators. In that light, the project videos are an intrinsic part of understanding how the outreach strategy worked from the site.
