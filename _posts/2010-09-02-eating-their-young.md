Ally Fogg: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/sep/02/youth-bad-news-stories">"Why the young get a bad press"</a> reports on research into age and media bias: 

<blockquote>Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick of Ohio State University gave 276 volunteers an online magazine to browse. She found that older people preferred to read negative news about young people, rather than positive news. What's more, those older readers who choose to read negative stories about young individuals receive a small boost to their self-esteem as a result. Younger readers, in contrast, prefer not to read about older people at all.</blockquote>
