This station includes several casts of early fossil <em>Homo erectus</em>, from the Early Pleistocene of Africa. These include: 

<ul>
<li>OH 9, from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, around 1.2 million years old.</li>
<li>KNM-ER 3733, from Ileret, Kenya, 1.65 million years old. </li>
<li>KNM-ER 3833, from Koobi Fora, Kenya, 1.6 million years old.</li>
<li>KNM-WT 15000, from Nariokotome, Kenya, 1.5 million years old.</li>
</ul>

In addition to these specimens, the station has a few comparative casts from earlier hominid species and from other parts of the world. 



<strong>What to do:</strong> First, consider the issue of <strong>sexual dimorphism</strong> in these specimens. Which are male and which are female? What features lead you to that conclusion? 



Second, why are the differences between these specimens and <em>Homo habilis</em>, for example, KNM-ER 1813, reflective of a <strong>species</strong> distinction, instead of sex?
