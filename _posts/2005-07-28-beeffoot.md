From <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8704462/">MSNBC</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>In the latest reported sighting, a group of Teslin residents told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. they heard branches cracking and saw a large human-like creature run by a house. It left behind large footprints, they said, and the hair tufts that were given to wildlife officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perhaps he is still stomping around somewhere, but a DNA test has confirmed that it was not Bigfoot roaming the Yukon earlier this month -- it was just a bison.</blockquote>
