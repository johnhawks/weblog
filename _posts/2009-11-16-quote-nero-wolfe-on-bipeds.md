Nero Wolfe, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553386034?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553386034"><i>The Rubber Band</i></a>, by Rex Stout:

<blockquote>What is it that he has been trying so desperately to preserve, with all his ruthless cunning? His position in society, his high repute among his fellow men, his nimbus as a master biped. Well, he will lose all that, which should be enough for any law.</blockquote>

This, in a book that used "biped" once earlier. It's got me thinking of lost hominin nimbuses. 

Nimbi?
