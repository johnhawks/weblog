PeerJ founder Peter Binfield answers questions for <em>Publishers' Weekly</em>: <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/52512-scholarly-publishing-2012-meet-peerj.html">"Scholarly Publishing 2012: Meet PeerJ "</a>.

<blockquote>First of all, we have no intention of becoming a social network, or any kind of Facebook for Scientists. But clearly our membership base does constitute a group of peers who will have various interactions that we can track and encourage. For example, a member might simultaneously be an author, a reviewer, a commenter, and an academic editorand we will facilitate all these interactions and will provide reputation systems that will track and display an individuals activity in each respect.</blockquote>

I'm interested in the <em>PeerJ</em> model, in which all authors must have paid lifetime memberships, and publication itself is open access with no author charges. Integrating the preprint server directly with the journal also strikes me as a good idea. What remains to be seen is whether the model will get over the hump that inhibits pre-publication and post-publication review.
