This <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1168312">thing about the artificial muscles</a> is incredibly cool: 

<blockquote>Carbon nanotube aerogel sheets are the sole component of new artificial muscles that provide giant elongations and elongation rates of 220% and (3.7 x 104)% per second, respectively, at operating temperatures from 80 to 1900 kelvin. These solid-statefabricated sheets are enthalpic rubbers having gaslike density and specific strength in one direction higher than those of steel plate.</blockquote>

So they're as light as air, as strong as steel, and they can pull faster than natural muscle.
