From an article about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/may/15/saturn-titan-robot-boat-sea">exploring Saturn's moon, Titan,</a> I have never in my life seen a scientist quote that sounds more like something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Frink">Professor Frink</a> would say: 

<blockquote>"Waves on Titan's seas will be far larger, but much slower, than on earthly oceans, according to our calculations," said Professor John Zarnecki, of the Open University. "That suggests Titan is the best spot in the solar system for surfing. The only trouble is that the temperature there is -180C (-290F). Either way you look at it, it is clear the place is pretty cool."</blockquote>

HOYVIN-GLAVIN!
