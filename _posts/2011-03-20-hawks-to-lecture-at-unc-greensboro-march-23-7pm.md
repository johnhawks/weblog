I'll be appearing this Wednesday night at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, to talk about Neandertal genetics. The lecture is in the Mead Auditorium, 101 Sullivan, at 7:00 pm. 

UNCG has <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/ure/news/stories/2011/mar/elliott032011.htm">a news announcement about the event</a>: 

<blockquote>At 7 p.m. March 23, paleoanthropologist John Hawks from the University of Wisconsin-Madison will deliver a talk in the Sullivan Science Building entitled Neandertime: Deciphering the Secrets of Ancient Genomes about evidence for genetic evolution among humans during the past 30,000 years. He is well known for his public engagement, which includes his own blog; work with mainstream media such as NPR, Slate and the New York Times; and appearances on Science Saturday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This years lecture series will also feature a panel discussion 3-5 p.m. the same day in Elliott University Center Auditorium that will consider the scientific study of human origins, evolution and variability as well as their everyday applications  that is, how they affect peoples lives in terms of biomedical practice, conceptions of difference and risk, and social identity. Moderated by Cheryl Logan, a professor of history and psychology at UNCG, the panel will include Lee Baker of Duke University, Fatimah Jackson of UNC Chapel Hill and Alondra Nelson of Columbia University.</blockquote>

I've got to tell you, the talk I'm giving about Neandertal genetics is the very best I've ever prepared. I don't say this kind of thing lightly, but if you're in the area and care about Neandertals, this is as good as it gets. We are discovering new stuff every day, the pace of discovery right now is running way ahead of the pace of publication. 

And this looks like it will be an engaging event. The lecture series has <a href="http://harrietelliottuncg.wordpress.com/">its own dedicated blog</a> where students and faculty have been exploring topics related to genetics and human evolution. The <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/aas/lectureseries/index.html">home page for the Harriet Elliott lectures</a> has more details.
