In the "great minds think alike" category, Gretchen sends me <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14922482/">this</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Man bites panda in Beijing zoo as retribution</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>BEIJING - A drunken Chinese migrant worker jumped into a panda enclosure at the Beijing Zoo, was bitten by the bear and retaliated by chomping down on the animal's back, state media said Wednesday.</blockquote>

<p>
Apparently "Gu Gu" got her own in, and the man is in stitches. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, another reader sends <a href="http://www.pandafix.com/pandafix/panda_lovemaking/index.html">this panda artificial insemination photo essay</a>, which, well, let's just say it may not be entirely work-safe. 
</p>

<p>
And that site (which approaches critter-fetish, I would say) has Google ads from <a href="http://www.obeybutterstick.com/">Obey Butterstick!</a>, which just seems weird: 
</p>

<blockquote>RIGHT THINKING WILL BE REWARDED WRONG THINKING WILL BE PUNISHED OBEY HIS PANDIC VISAGE</blockquote>

<blockquote>For too long we Pandas have been content to cavort for your pleasure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Eating bamboo, rolling in the mud, flashing our big cute eyes at you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No more. Panda Power is here.</blockquote>

<p>
I'm telling you, all this panda press is just encouraging these people.

<p>
On the other hand, it does have some more interesting qualities than this incessant hominid fossil reporting...
