Mark in Spokane <a href="http://markinspokane.blogspot.com/2010/01/thoughts-about-movie-avatar.html">opines about <i>Avatar</i></a>: 

<blockquote>I like a good story and all, but I also am a fan of humanity.  If I see a movie and it's aliens vs. humans, I'm rooting for the humans....  And that goes for wood elves, replicants, Cyclons, whatever.  </blockquote>

What's surprising to me is how many of his commenters are anti-human. It's like my undergraduates; they all seem to be convinced that humanity is evil. Hey, people! If you think <i>we're</i> evil, just wait until you run into an ecomaniacal alien species with some kind of telepathic dominion over their entire planet!
