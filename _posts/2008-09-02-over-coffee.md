<b>GREEDO:</b> Going somewhere, Solo?

<b>HAN SOLO:</b> Yes, Greedo. I was just coming to see your boss. Tell Jabba I have his money, at last. 

<b>GREEDO:</b> It's too late. You should have paid him at the first chance you had. Now Jabba's put a price on your head so large, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. 

<b>ME:</b> Oh forget it, Greedo, you know he's going to shoot you.

<b>GREEDO:</b> If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. 

<b>ME:</b> That rubber mask looks like a prop from the time Arthur was on Star Trek.

<b>GRETCHEN:</b> Dude, he's wearing a Members Only jacket!
