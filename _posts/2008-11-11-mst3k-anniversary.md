The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/arts/television/09dave.html"><i>NY Times</i> covers the 20th anniversary of Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>: 

<blockquote>MST3K may have been the first television show in which the commentary was more important than what was being commented on. You tuned in not to watch schlocky features like Fire Maidens of Outer Space or Manos: The Hands of Fate but to see how Mr. Hodgson and his crew would tear them apart. (You couldnt hear the dismal opening score of The Unearthly in the same way after one of Mr. Hodgsons robots shouted out, Music by the Edgar Allan Poe marching band!)</blockquote>

We miss that show...
