According to <i>New Scientist</i>, human activity and prior attempts to kill the fungus have made the ecology of Lascaux  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227094.600-human-pathogens-threaten-ancient-cave-art.html">similar to a hospital cooling tower</a>. 

<blockquote>The team conclude that a benzalkonium chloride spray applied between 2001 and 2004 to kill the fungus is to blame, as it allowed bacteria brought in by human visitors to thrive (Naturwissenschaften, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0540-y">DOI: 10.1007/s00114-009-0540-y</a>). "It produced a drastic change in the cave biodiversity," says [Cesareo[ Saiz-Jimenez.</blockquote>

The report mentions that the cave ecology now includes pathogens linked to disease outbreaks in humans. That seems like a good reason to stay out. Maybe <i>too</i> good. Like that part of <i>Close Encounters</i> where the army scatters dead cattle all over Wyoming.
