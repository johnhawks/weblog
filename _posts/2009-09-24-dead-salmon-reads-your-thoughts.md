Put <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/fmrisalmon/">dead fish in a scanner</a>, push the button, and see what happens:

<blockquote>By complete, random chance, we found some voxels that were significant that just happened to be in the fishs brain, Bennett said. And if I were a ridiculous researcher, Id say, A dead salmon perceiving humans can tell their emotional state.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The result is completely nuts  but thats actually exactly the point. Bennett, who is now a post-doc at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his adviser, George Wolford, wrote up the work as a warning about the dangers of false positives in fMRI data. </blockquote>

Our old friend, the multiple comparison -- 130,000 of them in this case. Elsewhere this month I was reading about the impressive fault-tolerance and noise-reducing properties of neural circuits. Those properties imply that functionally important signals will be lower than any reasonable false-positive threshold in a scan of so many multiple comparisons. 

So the problem is inevitable. Here's what concerns me: 

<blockquote>Bennetts paper has been turned down by several publications, but a poster on the work received an appreciative audience at the Human Brain Mapping conference earlier this summer. Neuroscience researchers have been forwarding it to each other for weeks.</blockquote>

Yes, use the editorial process to silence the internal critiques. Good plan, there, neuroscientists.
