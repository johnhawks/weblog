The papers are just being released. I have had copies for a while and have lots of commentary, which I'll be putting up in the next day or so -- the delay is, I've been waiting for the online papers to cut-and-paste quotes instead of retyping from my paper copies. 
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I suggest <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/neanderthaldna/index.html">the saturation coverage page</a> at <i>Nature</i>, which includes <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/abs/nature05336.html">the <i>Nature</i> paper</a> by Green et al., news articles, video with Henry Gee (oh, lord), and podcasts. 
</p>

Oh, and if you're wondering what the heck I'm talking about, here's a quote from <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/444275a.html">the accompanying commentary</a> by Lambert and Millar:
</p>

<blockquote>In this issue, P&auml;&auml;bo and colleagues (Green et al., page 330) describe the sequencing of more than a million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA; for comparison, the human genome is approximately 3.2 billion base pairs long. In collaboration with P&auml;&auml;bo's group, Rubin and colleagues (Noonan et al.) report in Science their use of a different method to recover 65,000 base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. These papers are perhaps the most significant contributions published in this field since the discovery of Neanderthals 150 years ago.</blockquote>

There, now we're on the same page!

UPDATE (11/15/2006): My regular server has gone down under the demand and I have moved to the backup. This will impact the regular features of the site, including some of the navigation, because it is static instead of dynamic. So if you are reading for the first time, something might not work right; and it will be fixed by tomorrow. Thanks for coming by, and please stop in again!
