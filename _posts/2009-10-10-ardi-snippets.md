The Discovery Channel has posted some short video snippets of the upcoming <i>Ardipithecus</i> special. I was sent a link to Owen Lovejoy telling us a <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/ardipithecus-genetic-caution.html">"Genetic Caution"</a>. 

I thought it might be about the problem of the 4-million-year human-chimp divergence. But it turned out to be a simple restatement of Jon Marks' point about genetic similarity -- the numbers don't mean much in terms of function or selection: 

"It means as much to say we're 98 percent chimpanzee as it does to say we're 50 percent fruit fly." 

Whether it's their consumer data mining about my purchasing habits, or a general message I'm not sure....but I got a diaper commercial before the video loaded. 

There may be more of interest in the other snippets, and they are all short so take little time to explore.
