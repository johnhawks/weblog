Traci Watson from <em>National Geographic</em> reports on a study of behavior in whales looking specifically at how members of social groups react to the death of an individual in their group: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/whales-death-grief-animals-science/">"Whales Mourn Their Dead, Just Like Us"</a>. 

<blockquote>In one case, short-finned pilot whales in the North Atlantic Ocean made a protective circle around an adult and dead calf. In another case, a spinner dolphin in the Red Sea pushed a young animal’s body toward a boat. When the vessel’s occupants lifted the carcass on board, the entire group of dolphins nearby circled the boat and swam off.</blockquote>

Many of the behaviors that they describe are similar to those seen in primates and other terrestrial social mammals like elephants.
