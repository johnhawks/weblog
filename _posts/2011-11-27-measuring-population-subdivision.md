The basic measure of genetic difference between two populations is the statistic, <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub>. In genetics, the term <em>F</em> generally stands for ``inbreeding'', which tends to reduce genetic variation in the population. Genetic variation can be measured by heterozygosity, and so <em>F</em> generally expresses a reduction in the heterozygosity in the population. <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub> is the reduction in heterozygosity in subpopulations compared to the total population of which they are part. 


To estimate <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub>, take the following steps: 

<ol>
<li> Find the allele frequencies for each subpopulation. </li>
<li> Find the <em>average</em> allele frequencies for the total population. </li>
<li> Calculate the heterozygosity (2<em>pq</em>) for each subpopulation. </li>
<li> Calculate the <em>average</em> of these subpopulation heterozygosities. This is <em>H</em><sub>S</sub>. </li>
<li> Calculate the heterozygosity based on the total population allele frequencies. This is <em>H</em><sub>T</sub>. </li>
<li> Finally, calculate <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub>=(<em>H</em><sub>T</sub>-<em>H</em><sub>S</sub>)/<em>H</em><sub>T</sub>.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Don't forget that the <em>H</em><sub>S</sub> term is the average across all subpopulations.</strong>

<strong>Example:</strong> The gene <em>SLC24A5</em> is a key part of the melanin expression pathway, which contributes to skin and hair pigmentation. A SNP that is strongly associated with lighter skin pigment in Europe is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?searchType=adhoc_search&type=rs&rs=rs1426654">rs1426654</a>. The SNP has two alleles, A and G, with G being associated with light skin, at a frequency of 100% in Utah European-Americans. The SNP varies in frequency in populations in the Americas with mixed African and American Indian ancestry. A sample in Mexico had 38% A and 62% G; in Puerto Rico the frequencies were 59% A and 41% G, and a sample of African-Americans from Charleston had 19% A with 81% G. What is the <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub> in this example?
