A <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/full/451627c.html">letter to the editors of <i>Nature</i> by Jasmina Muzinic</a> notes the new translation of Darwin's works into Croatian: 
</p>

<blockquote>Charles Darwin's <i>On the Origin of Species</i> and <i>The Descent of Man</i> have at last been translated into Croatian, thanks to the work of the renowned science and theology translator Josip Balabanic. Other European countries -- including Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Sweden -- had access to Darwin's works in their mother tongue during his lifetime. But it was not until this year that Croatian students of biology could read them in their own language.</blockquote>
