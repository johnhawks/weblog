<i>SEED</i> magazine commissioned me to write <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/uncovering_ardi/">an article about <i>Ardipithecus</i></a>. It's general interest and doesn't have stuff that my blog readers haven't seen, but I do like this analogy: 

<blockquote>For comparison, sit down and bend your leg at the knee. With the heel of your hand just under your knee, chances are you can reach halfway down your shin. From that same position, Ardi could tickle her toes.</blockquote>
