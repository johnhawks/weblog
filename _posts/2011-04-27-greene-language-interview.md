The Browser gives us an interesting interview with the <i>Economist's</i> Robert Lane Greene, (<a href="http://thebrowser.com/interviews/robert-lane-greene-on-language-and-mind">"Robert Lane Greene on Language and the Mind"</a>). Greene has a recent book on language, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553807870/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0553807870"><i>You Are What You Speak: Grammar Grouches, Language Laws, and the Politics of Identity</i></a>. 

The interview is really interesting because they get Greene to give mini-reviews of around a half-dozen books about language and its evolution that have been published in the last twenty years or so. He has useful things to say about several, and actually made me want to read one I haven't yet seen: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812980891/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0812980891"><i>In the Land of Invented Languages: Adventures in Linguistic Creativity, Madness, and Genius</i></a>, about "invented" languages from Esparanto to Klingon.
