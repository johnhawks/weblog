Dennis Etler has been going great guns on his blog, <a href="http://sinanthropus.blogspot.com/">Sinanthropus</a>. 

<a href="">Last week's article</a> claiming cutmarks on <i>A. afarensis</i>-aged fauna from Dikika (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/archaeology/lower/dikikia-cutmarks-mcpherron-2010.html"><i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> used stone tools</a>) got Dennis to write a provocative post: <a href="http://sinanthropus.blogspot.com/2010/08/its-time-to-sink-genus-australopithecus.html">"Its time to sink the genus <i>Australopithecus</i> redux."</a>

<blockquote>Either <i>A. afarensis</i> should be revised to <i>H. afarensis</i> or the possibility must be entertained that the Woranso-Mille individual and the maker of the stone tool cut marks at Dikika represent a new previously unknown species of <i>Homo</i> (perhaps <i>H. antiquus</i> Ferguson 1984) that lived contemporaneously with <i>A. afarensis</i>.</blockquote>

He mentions the relevance of the Woranso-Mille skeleton (which I haven't yet gotten to here) and <i>A. sediba</i> for this conclusion. Etler's earlier post, <a href="http://sinanthropus.blogspot.com/2010/06/its-time-to-sink-genus-australopithecus.html">"It's time to sink the genus <i>Australopithecus"</a> goes into more detail on these remains. 

To me, the key question is whether <i>Homo</i> as we understand it now (including <i>H. habilis</i>) is polyphyletic. One way to escape this question is to <b>narrow</b> our genus, placing <i>H. habilis</i> and its ilk into <i>Australopithecus</i>. But <i>Australopithecus</i> defined broadly in this way is almost certainly paraphyletic. And that's without considering the issue of robust australopithecines. I can see why one might follow Ernst Mayr and stick them all in <i>Homo</i>.
