After this week's <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2409">description of the new public accessibility of the Dmanisi site</a>, a reader sends a link to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/15/sterkfontein-caves-south-africa">a tour of Sterkfontein by <i>The Guardian's</i> David Smith</a>:

<blockquote>Wandering through the cool, dark caves, I looked up at a gate behind which the excavation of Little Foot continued. Around me were the jagged walls and roof, soaring majestically above our heads like nature's cathedral. The rocks had been worn into random shapes by the millennia. One, said the guide, shining a torch, looked like the trunk and ears of an elephant.</blockquote>
