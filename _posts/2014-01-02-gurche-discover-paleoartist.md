<em>Discover</em> magazine is running an incredible article by John Gurche about the process of creating his artistic reconstructions of early hominins: <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/galleries/2013/dec/paleoartist-reconstructs-human-ancestors#.UsYq95GzxQA">"Making Lucy: A Paleoartist Reconstructs Long-Lost Human Ancestors"</a>. 


Here's how he begins:


<blockquote>I have an interesting job. Some days it might involve paying a woman to climb up and down a pole naked while I take notes and photographs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But thatâ€™s a terrible way to begin. Let me explain.</blockquote>

The article is richly illustrated with photos from Gurche's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300182023/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300182023&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20"><em>Shaping Humanity: How Science, Art, and Imagination Help Us Understand Our Origins</em></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=johnhawksanth-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0300182023" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. A great demonstration of the importance of anatomical knowledge.
