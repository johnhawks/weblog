Razib Khan's post at his new digs (Discover blogs) about the 17q21 inversion is worth reading for anyone interested in the complexities of discovering the history of genes in populations (<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/04/the-many-lives-of-an-inverted-genomic-region/">"The many lives of an inverted genetic region"</a>). 

The inversion in this region, common in Europeans, was <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/stefansson_2005_inversion.html">described in 2005</a> as one of the earliest clear examples of recent positive selection determined from genotype data alone. It appeared that the apparently selected allele had diverged quite a long time ago from the wild type, leading to the hypothesis that it had sojourned in some ancient species of hominins before re-entering the human population by introgression. 

But complexities followed -- for one thing, the region has <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/17q-pennisi-review-2008.html">repeatedly undergone inversions in other primate lineages</a>. Now, as Razib points out, it looks like the inversion isn't all that old. 

It's all very curious...
