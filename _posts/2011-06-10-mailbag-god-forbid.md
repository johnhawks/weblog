Re: donations: 

<blockquote>Dear Mr Hawks,
 
Your blog is fascinating, but I just thought you might like to know that the phrase (god forbid!) by your donation button rather put me off donating. It might do the same for others. Its fairly ambiguous, but appears to be making a political point of some kind, which could be at either end of the political spectrum.</blockquote>

Thank you so much for letting me know and for your kind words. I'm glad you have found enough value in the site to consider a donation. The support of a few generous people lets me keep things going for all the students and international readers who don't have great sources of information about human evolution. 

A lot of people think that NSF and other grant agencies provide funding to scientists for science outreach activities, but with few exceptions they don't. I'm very happy and grateful to be entirely reader-supported.
