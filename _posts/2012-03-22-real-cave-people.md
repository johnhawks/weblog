The <em>LA Times</em> has an interesting article about modern cave life in Shaanxi: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-caves-20120318,0,2352472.story">"In China, millions make themselves at home in caves"</a>. 

<blockquote>"It's like living in a villa. Caves in our villages are as comfortable as posh apartments in the city," said Cheng Wei, 43, a Communist Party official who lives in one of the cave houses in Zaoyuan village on the outskirts of Yanan. "A lot of people come here looking to rent our caves, but nobody wants to move out."</blockquote>
