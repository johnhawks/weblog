William. W. Howells (1980), writing on the way that new discoveries have affected the interpretation of <em>Homo erectus</em>:

<blockquote>The pattern of discovery to a degree continues that of the past. Java has gone on producing material at a familiar pace, while in Europe fossils have been sparse and fragmentary, with two spectacular exceptions (Petralona, Arago), India continues a blank; China has just begun to produce significant finds again. Africa has taken more of its rightful place. However, if one were to take Weidenreich or Boule as a standard, description has been rather slow, and even preparation, especially in the case of delicate specimens, has delayed up full appreciation of some finds.</blockquote>
