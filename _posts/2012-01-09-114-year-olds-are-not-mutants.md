Alexis Madrigal for the <em>Atlantic</em>: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/01/the-surprisingly-mundane-genetic-secrets-of-earths-oldest-people/251009/">"The Surprisingly Mundane Genetic 'Secrets' of Earth's Oldest People"</a>. 

<blockquote>Recently, the genomes of two 114-year-olds were published by a Boston University team in <em>Frontiers in Genetics of Aging</em>. Though one older person is believed to have had her genome sequenced, the new duo are the oldest people to have had their genomes published.</blockquote>

Of course, sequencing two genomes to discover no Mendelian variants of large effect on longevity seems like overkill. It's amazing how much human genetics is driven by an X-Men model of inheritance. Come on, people -- learn some evolutionary theory!
