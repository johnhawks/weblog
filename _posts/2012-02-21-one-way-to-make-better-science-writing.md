Alison Flood in the <em>Guardian</em> notes the scientific interests of celebrated novelist Cormac McCarthy: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/feb/21/cormac-mccarthy-scientific-copy-editor">"Cormac McCarthy's parallel career revealed  as a scientific copy editor!"</a> The article mainly discusses Lawrence Krauss' biography of Richard Feynman, but then turns to a broader history of McCarthy's times at the Santa Fe Institute. 

<blockquote>McCarthy performed a similar service for the Harvard physicist Lisa Randall in 2005 for her first book, Warped Passages: Unravelling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. "He gave it a good copy-edit," Randall told the Radcliffe Quarterly. "He really smoothed the prose." Like Krauss, Randall also found superfluous punctuation removed from her debut. "Cormac isolated all the semicolons in the margin; I then removed them," she told the New York Times. "Apparently exclamation points are only for exclamations! Those were removed too."</blockquote>

The best part (for those who've met him) is how Murray Gell-Mann "was too rushed" to take McCarthy's line edits!
