Razib Khan <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/is-resurrecting-neandertals-unethical/">raises the question whether Neandertal cloning could be ethical</a>, and a varied comment thread quickly ensues. 

People seem to confuse "ethics" with "ick factor". My favorite line from the discussion so far: 

<blockquote>also, though i do think it is legit to argue that resurrecting neandertals is not ethical, it is instructive to note that many of the objections being made here (e.g., oh so ugly!) can apply to normal modern humans. e.g., that couple be 00glee, they shouldnt breed and produce 00glee kids. to me that doesnt nullify the objection, but it strikes me that these arent qualitative issues with neandertals as such.</blockquote>

I wonder how much Neanderhating could be set to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_People">Randy Newman lyrics</a>?
