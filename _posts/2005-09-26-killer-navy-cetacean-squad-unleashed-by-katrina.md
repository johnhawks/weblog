On the topic of animal intelligence, there is <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1577753,00.html">this from <i>The Observer</i></a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>It may be the oddest tale to emerge from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Armed dolphins, trained by the US military to shoot terrorists and pinpoint spies underwater, may be missing in the Gulf of Mexico.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Experts who have studied the US navy's cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying 'toxic dart' guns. Divers and surfers risk attack, they claim, from a species considered to be among the planet's smartest. The US navy admits it has been training dolphins for military purposes, but has refused to confirm that any are missing.</blockquote>

Apparently Navy personel are demanding to inspect other missing captive dolphins that have been found after the storms, leading some to believe they must have lost their own, which were headquartered near Lake Pontchartrain.

<blockquote>'My concern is that they have learnt to shoot at divers in wetsuits who have simulated terrorists in exercises. If divers or windsurfers are mistaken for a spy or suicide bomber and if equipped with special harnesses carrying toxic darts, they could fire,' [accident investigator Leo Sheridan, 72] said. 'The darts are designed to put the target to sleep so they can be interrogated later, but what happens if the victim is not found for hours?'</blockquote>

<p>
What, indeed...
