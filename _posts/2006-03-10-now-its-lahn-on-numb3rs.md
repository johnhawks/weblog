OK, <i>Numb3rs</i> is definitely the coolest crime show on television. In December, there was <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/tv/numbers_kennewick_2005.html">the episode with the pseudo-Kennewick skeleton</a>. Now, the two math guys are having a conversation about Bruce Lahn's work -- recent evolution of <i>microcephalin</i> and <i>ASPM</i>! 
</p>

<p>
Not only that, they're discussing them as possible evidence for recent changes in human mental abilities. Of course, in the context of this episode, that means psychic abilities....

Hey, if you writers are reading the blog, let me know, OK? I'll keep it on the DL if you want.
