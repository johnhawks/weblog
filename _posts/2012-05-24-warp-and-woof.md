James Gorman stirs the pot on dog domestication, by comparing the new review article by Greger Larson and colleagues <bib>Larson:dog:2012</bib> with Pat Shipman's <em>American Scientist</em> piece <bib>Shipman:eyes:2012</bib> (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/science/dogs-and-humans-speculation-and-science.html">"What-If and What-Is: The Role of Speculation in Science"</a>). This is a complex story, and Gorman lines the two papers in opposition to each other -- the data-focused paper by Larson and colleagues, which ultimately has an ambiguous conclusion, opposed to the speculative paper by Shipman, with relatively little empirical data and a strong prediction. 

I won't go into the whole argument, which you can read at the link, but it boils down to whether the archaeological evidence shows early dogs or not. 

<blockquote>If dogs were watching us too, that would have added survival value to having a partly white eye and thus played a role in our evolution. Fair enough, but the dogs had to be there at that time when humans and Neanderthals overlapped. I asked Dr. Larson about Dr. Shipmans essay, and I confess I expected he might object to its speculative nature. Not so. I love speculation, he wrote back, I do it all the time. And, he said of Dr. Shipmans essay, its a lovely chain of reasoning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But, he said, it begins from the premise that the late Pleistocene canid remains are dogs. And they are not.</blockquote>

I rather like the new Larson paper, but there are some weak points. Dog domestication was a complex process and ultimately we will need a lot more genetic data from zoo archaeology to sort it out.
