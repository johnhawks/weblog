Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/goodwin-watercolor-sketches-2009.jpg" width="400" height="291" alt="Watercolor sketches of Goodwin" />
</div>

Actually, yesterday's. Goodwin and I were painting outside. Here's a watercolor sketch of him painting. The girls' school had a Blackhawk helicopter visit, landing right outside. It flew over the house bound for its base, and I caught Goodwin looking up with a colored pencil sketch.
