Corey Binns of LiveScience <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11418262">reports on</a> a presentation at the AAAS by psychologist Athena Vouloumanos: 
</p>

<blockquote>Straight out of the womb, infants are just as aroused by a rhesus monkey call as by human speech.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It was very shocking," Vouloumanos told LiveScience. "I thought for sure that they would prefer the human speech. I kept testing more babies because I couldn't believe it."</blockquote>

<p>
This was a "suck" test, where they measure how hard the babies suck on special pacifiers in response to different noises. Three-month-old babies liked human speech more than they liked monkey noise. 
</p>

<p>
It does make you wonder if there is a sort of "imprinting" stage during which babies are conditioned to like human voices. The article mentions that newborns are more aroused by folk music than white noise -- I can confirm and extend this, since our babies seemed to be highly aroused by <a href="http://www.bbvd.com/">Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</a>. 
</p>

<p>
But voices may be harder to distinguish from monkey noise than rhythmic music is from white noise. It may be another of those deep social brain problems.
