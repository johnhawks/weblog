A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7966641.stm">case in Germany</a> illustrates how easy it can be for contamination to sneak into labs from unexpected sources: 

<blockquote>Police in Germany have admitted that a woman they have been hunting for more than 15 years never in fact existed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>She was alternatively called the "woman without a face" and the "phantom of Heilbronn" after the city in southern Germany where she allegedly killed a policewoman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Police suspicions were based on traces of identical female DNA they found at 40 crime scenes across southern Germany and Austria.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now it has been determined that the cotton swabs used to collect DNA had been contaminated accidently by a woman working at an unidentified factory in Bavaria.</blockquote>

The company selling the swabs did not claim they were DNA-free or certified for use in DNA analysis.
