The <em>Daily Mail</em> is running a pictorial showing hominin reconstructions from Kennis and Kennis, who are being featured in a show in Dresden, Germany: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2083262/Exhibition-uses-forensics-rebuild-27-faces-mans-ancestors-stretching-7m-years.html">"Meet the grandparents: Researchers use forensics to rebuild 27 faces of man's ancestors, stretching back 7 million years"</a>. 

Their reconstructions have an emotive quality that really appeals to me, and it's shame the pictorial <em>doesn't ever name the artists!</em>
