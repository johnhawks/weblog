Reading back through some of my old posts, I came across this comparison illustrating the way that <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/information/status_money_cognition_2005.html">status can trump economic rewards</a>:

<blockquote>Consider the rewards that come with being the best-dressed Dr. Frank-N-Furter at the local Rocky Horror Picture Show revival. Or that come along with the publication of an academic book. </blockquote>

So true, so true.
