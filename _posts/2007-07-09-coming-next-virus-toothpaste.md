I couldn't help but wonder after reading <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070709111338.htm">this story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Bacterial biofilms can form almost anywhere, even on your teeth if you don't brush for a day or two. When they accumulate in hard to reach places such as the insides of food processing machines or medical catheters, however, they become persistent sources of infection.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These bacteria excrete a variety of proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids that together with other accumulating materials form an extracellular matrix, or in Lu's words, a "slimy layer," that encases the bacteria. Traditional remedies such as antibiotics are not as effective on these bacterial biofilms as they are on free-floating bacteria. In some cases, antibiotics even encourage bacterial biofilms to form.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lu and senior author James Collins, professor of biomedical engineering at BU, aim to eradicate these biofilms using bacteriophage, tiny viruses that attack bacteria. Phage have long been used in Eastern Europe and Russia to treat infection.</blockquote>

The story describes research that built a sort of "phage toolkit", for those times when you don't "want to dig through sewage to find these phages."
