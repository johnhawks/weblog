Marie-Claire Shanahan has written on A Blog Around the Clock <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/07/uc_berkeley_genetic_testing_af.php">an essay discussing the Berkeley genetic test</a>:

<blockquote>I chatted informally with some friends about the issue. One expressed her divided feelings about it saying (roughly quoted) "It seems like they [university admin] have addressed the ethical concerns well by being clear about the use of the swabs and the confidentiality but something still just doesn't feel right. There's still a part of me that shivers just a little bit."</blockquote>

<blockquote>What is the shiver factor?</blockquote>

Her thoughts provide another perspective, and I hope more will come. 

I think that the test does two things. It requires that students give a different kind of trust to the university -- for information that's not covered by the usual federal protections of student records, and that requires a new "consent statement". To enforce this new trust, the test imposes a pressure from peers and faculty upon students. 

I don't see how that trust has been earned. Especially by the University of California system -- remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_v._Regents_of_the_University_of_California">MoCell?</a>
