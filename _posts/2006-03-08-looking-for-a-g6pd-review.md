I'm linking to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7949118">this 1994 review article by Ernest Beutler</a> (<a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/reprint/84/11/3613">straight to PDF</a>) because (a) it has over 400 references that pretty much cover every bit of G6PD knowledge up to 1994, and (b) the PDF is protected so I can't save a local copy. 
</p>

This is really getting annoying. This article is from the archives of <i>Blood</i> and it is available for free download, for goodness sake! Meanwhile, I can hardly save a <i>Nature</i> paper anymore -- I've had some sitting open on my computer for weeks and I can't close them without having to go download them again. 
</p>

<p>
I guess I'll probably start linking such things here more, just so I don't have to Google things I've already read.

UPDATE (3/8/2006): Thanks to all the readers who sent me the article! The DRM doesn't work on everyone but the current OS X seems to be especially clever about defeating my attempts to get around it (including your suggestions). The best I have seen so far is a compiler switch for Xpdf, so if you're technically inclined, there you go.

<p>
The ironic part is that I ended up cutting the G6PD reference from the paper! Oh, well; it will return in the longer version.
