Discovery News has a short article about Australian archaeologist Katherine Szabo's analyses of <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/03/30/shell-tools-archaeology.html">tools made of shell instead of stone</a> in Late Pleistocene contexts: 

<blockquote>In published research to date, Szabo reports having excavated shell tools dating back 32,000 years from a cave site in eastern Indonesia, and comparing them with stone tools from the same cave.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It transpired that the shell tools were in fact much more complex to produce than the stone tools," she said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The stone tools were randomly chipped, but the shell tools had been carefully chosen and shaped.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In one case, a "cats eye" or operculum shell was flaked systematically with five blows, each one slightly overlapping with the last in a clockwise direction.</blockquote>

I want to mention along with this story that one of our own Ph.D.'s, Kildo Choi, published a paper in 2007, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2006.03.013">"Shell tool use by early members of <i>Homo erectus</i> in Sangiran, central Java, Indonesia: cut mark evidence"</a>. That paper documented cutmarks on early Pleistocene faunal elements that were made by clamshell, not stone. So the use of shell as a raw material probably goes back hundreds of thousands of years in the area.
