It's hard to predict folding patterns of RNA in cells. As Hayley Dunning describes, RNA has been "gamified" to give scientists some help: <a href="http://the-scientist.com/2012/06/26/toying-with-rna/">"Toying with RNA"</a>. 

<blockquote>Players of the game EteRNA are given a real-world RNA shape and asked to manipulate a chain of nucleotides to fit that shape, by observing how different patterns of nucleotides form certain structures, like loops or tails. Then, every week, a few molecules are selected for synthesis in a lab at Stanford to see how closely they match the desired shape.</blockquote>

The game itself, <a href="http://eterna.cmu.edu/eterna_page.php?page=me_tab">"EteRNA"</a>, is pretty cute. It took me a few tries to realize it's pronounced like the first six-sevenths of "eternal". 

I wish there were some way to gamify paleoanthropology. I mean, something more illuminating than just sticking Neandertals into World of Warcraft.
