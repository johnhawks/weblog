This is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15294523/">a neat story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>GREENSBURG, Kan. - Scientists located a rare meteorite in a Kansas wheat field thanks to new ground penetrating radar technology that some day might be used on Mars.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The dig Monday was likely the most documented excavation yet of a meteorite find, with researchers painstakingly using brushes and hand tools in order to preserve evidence of the impact trail and to date the event of the meteorite strike. Soil samples were also bagged and tagged, and organic material preserved for dating purposes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even before they had the meteorite out of the ground, the scientific experts at the site were able to debunk prevailing wisdom that the spectacular Brenham meteorite fall occurred 20,000 years ago. Its location in the Pleistocene epoch soil layer puts that date closer to 10,000 years ago.</blockquote>

<p>
The "Brenham" meteorite was a 450 kg specimen found in 1949, and pieces of the same impactor are all over the county. An even bigger chunk was <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10007802/">found last year</a> only a mile or two away, and it was the third biggest of its type ever found. This is another piece of the same rock, but found in the ground so that they can date it.

I find it interesting that here we have a highly dispersed resource, which probably occurs with nearly equal probability anywhere in the world, but very rarely. So a few people have specialized to find them, because they are scientifically interesting and worth a <i>lot</i> of money. And they used to be limited to looking in places with lots of permanent ice (where melts made them easy to find on the surface) or places with very little vegetation, like deserts, where -- again -- they are stuck on the surface.

<p>
But technology has made it possible to find them in a broader range of contexts, so it's an open field for searching. Of course, in this case there's a reason to look harder, since there are fragments of the same ancient meteorite all over the county.
