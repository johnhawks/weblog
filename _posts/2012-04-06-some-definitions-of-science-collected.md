From Maria Popova of Brainpickings: <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/04/06/what-is-science/">"What Is Science? From Feynman to Sagan to Asimov to Curie, an Omnibus of Definitions"</a>. 

<blockquote>So, what exactly is science, what does it aspire to do, and why should we the people care? It seems like a simple question, but its an infinitely complex one, the answer to which is ever elusive and contentious. Gathered here are several eloquent definitions that focus on science as process rather than product, whose conduit is curiosity rather than certainty.</blockquote>
