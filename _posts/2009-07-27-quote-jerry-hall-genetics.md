There was a really stupid article in the <i>Times</i> (UK) yesterday: <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article6727710.ece">"Women are getting more beautiful"</a>. You know I don't say that lightly. But I had to quote what passes for a demonstration of heritability these days: 

<blockquote>The heritability of attractiveness is widely accepted. When Elizabeth Jagger became a model, her mother, the former model Jerry Hall, said: Its in her genes.</blockquote>

Wouldn't it make life easier if we could just rely on celebrities for all these things? Er, maybe not....
