We flipped the TV to the National Geographic Channel last night to watch <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/human-family-tree-3706-interactive">"The Human Family Tree" special</a>. I like the premise of testing the relations of people from one mixed location -- they picked Queens, NY. And having Kevin Bacon tell us how closely connected we all are -- that's what I call a genius casting choice. 

So I'm interested, but as the show started, it gave a scary warning about "cultural situations" and the narration started talking about "more than sex". It wasn't great kids bedtime material for us yesterday. Maybe I'll catch a rebroadcast.
