The Freakonomics blog ran <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/buzz-aldrin-answers-your-questions/#more-17743">a Q-and-A with astronaut Buzz Aldrin</a>. 

<blockquote>Your life changes because of the significance of being put on a historical pedestal and the demands of answering questions like what did it feel like? what were your emotions? and other vague questions. To tell them that I took a leak on the moon jazzes up interest, but it doesnt answer the question.</blockquote>

That's followed by some vague questions, but some focused ones as well, with Aldrin's buzzworthy responses.
