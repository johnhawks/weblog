A Danish newspaper <a href="http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article611464.ece">reports on some recent ice core research</a>: 

<blockquote>A Danish ice drilling project has conclusively ended the discussion on the exact date of the end of the last ice age. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The extensive scientific study shows that it was precisely 11,711 years ago - and not the indeterminate figure of some 11,000 years ago  that the ice withdrew, allowing humans and animals free reign. </blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Our new, extremely detailed data from the examination of the ice cores shows that in the transition from the ice age to our current warm, interglacial period the climate shift is so sudden that it is as if a button was pressed, explains ice core researcher Jrgen Peder Steffensen, Centre for Ice and Climate at NBI at the University of Copenhagen. </blockquote>

These rapid climate reversals seem to have been a growing theme for the last decade or so. I think a review of chronology of the last 40,000 years might be in order here. I'll put it on my list.
