An excellent discussion of the legal issues involved in current attempts to put intelligent design in public school curricula is
<a href="https://supreme.findlaw.com/legal-commentary/why-its-unconstitutional-to-teach-intelligent-design-in-the-public-schools-as-an-alternative-to-evolution.html">an article by Michael C. Dorf on FindLaw</a>. In particular, he focuses on the legal argument around legislative intent that featured in <i>Edwards v. Aguilard</i>, and why that may or may not make a difference in challenges based on intelligent design.

Dorf also includes a thumbnail description of why ID is not science. Good reading.
