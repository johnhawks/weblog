This week's <i>NY Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html">Science section</a> is devoted to evolution, with articles by: 
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26lab.html?ref=science">Carl Zimmer, on microbial evolution</a>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26ance.html?ref=science">John Noble Wilford, on human paleontology</a>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26human.html?ref=science">Nicholas Wade, on recent human genetic evolution</a>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26devo.html?ref=science">Carol Kaesuk Yoon, on evo-devo</a>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/science/26essay.html?ref=science">An essay by Douglas Erwin, about evo-devo and Darwinism</a>

<p>
And several other things. I will be reading through these articles over the next several days and providing some annotation and commentary -- I think they are an interesting compilation of recent (and some older) developments in evolutionary science.
