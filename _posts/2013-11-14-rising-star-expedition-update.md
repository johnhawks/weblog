For the past five days, I've been cataloguing dozens of fossils from the Rising Star site. The <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/">National Geographic Rising Star Expedition blog</a> has some incredible video shorts from the site, and some short blog posts describing what is coming out. Here's one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H2Gg-Jkxlw">"See First Fossil Recovered from Cave (Expedition Update)"</a>.

We are experimenting with many different ways of sharing what we are doing here. Both Lee Berger and I are live-tweeting the excavation as it goes on; the cavers and scientists have done Skype sessions with schools; we have the exceptional coverage from the National Geographic bloggers; and we are immediately releasing lots of info on what we are finding. Even the team was recruited with social media. 

Shortly I will start blogging about our progress here. Many of those posts will be cross-posted with National Geographic. Initially I will link to them from here, later I'll cross-post them.  We have good internet here but if anything happens with my server I may not be able to fix it quickly, so I'll be updating first to NatGeo. 

UPDATE (2013-11-15): The NatGeo blog has been reorganized and has a new address. Correct link above and: http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/blog/rising-star-expedition/
