The <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/">Darwin Correspondence Project</a> has put the text of 5000 Darwin letters online. The <i>NY Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/weekinreview/20word.html">has a number of excerpts</a>. Here's a good one:

Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a "tendency to progression" "adaptations from the slow willing of animals" ... but the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his &mdash; though the means of change are wholly so &mdash; I think I have found out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends.</blockquote>
