David Swindle, <a href="http://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2012/02/10/george-lucas-confirms-it-the-star-wars-we-loved-never-existed/">writing at PJ Media</a> about George Lucas' revelation that Han Solo would never have shot first. 

<blockquote>Heres the medicine we all need to swallow: as children we were more grown up than George Lucas is now as an adult. Han Solos entire character rested on what we saw in that early scene in the film. In shooting first Han Solo was a role model doing what any Real Man was supposed to do. Now we know that character only existed in our imaginations, not his creators. And that George Lucas regards most of his fans as amoral neanderthals.</blockquote>

Han shooting first has <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1632">appeared previously here</a>. It's quite obvious that any moral Neandertal would have shot first, too. No one who brought us midichlorians can be trusted on matters of morality.
