There's not really an exciting story to go with the headline, but after it dropped into my news feed, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-we-spent-facebooks-money-on-neanderthals-skull-2009-12">I had to link it:</a> 

<blockquote><b>How We Spent Facebook's Money On A Neanderthal's Skull</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Yesterday, a nice Christmas present from Facebook landed in our in-box: $25 to spend at DonorsChoose.org.

After reviewing reader suggestions on how to spend it, we eventually decided to help a North Carolina school teacher buy his students a model of a Neanderthal skull for AP biology students.</blockquote>

Well, OK -- short, and heartwarming. I think every school could use a Neandertal skull.
