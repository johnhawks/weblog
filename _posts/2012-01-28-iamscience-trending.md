I want to point to this powerful personal story by marine biologist and friend Kevin Zelnio: <a href="http://deepseanews.com/2012/01/iamscience-embracing-personal-experience-on-our-rise-through-science/">"#IamScience: Embracing Personal Experience on Our Rise Through Science"</a>. It may make a difference to some readers who are struggling to build careers in science or anthropology.
