I was in a conversation last night about a book I had really enjoyed this year, and I remarked that I had meant to review it on the blog and hadn't done it yet. The book is Dale Guthrie's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226311260?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226311260"><i>The Nature of Paleolithic Art</i></a>, which I enjoyed for the text and his style of analysis, but most especially for the many hundreds of hand-rendered drawings of Paleolithic cave art.

It's a tremendous body of work. I may write more when I get home this week, but in the meantime, it's a great gift for artists or people who like art, with an interest in the prehistoric. And it's at a great price.
