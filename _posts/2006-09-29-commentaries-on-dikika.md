The online companion site to <i>Scientific American</i> is running commentaries by a few paleoanthropologists on the importance of the new DIK-1-1 skeleton. It's an <a href="http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=lucy_s_baby_join_the_discussion_and_take&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">experiment in online publishing</a>, and it has turned out some very good material, including commentaries by <a href="http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=expert_observations_on_lucy_s_baby_c_owe&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">Owen Lovejoy</a>, <a href="http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=expert_commentary_on_lucy_s_baby_ralph_h&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">Ralph Holloway</a>, <a href="http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=expert_commentary_on_lucy_s_baby_diana_c&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">Diana Roman</a>, and, well, <a href="http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=expert_commentary_on_lucy_s_baby_john_ha&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">me</a>.

These other commentators and the press of the last week are hard to follow, but actually my second thought about the skeleton has turned out to be fairly original: 
</p>

<blockquote>The new Dikika skeleton has me wondering one thing: did Selam sink <i>Kenyanthropus</i>?</blockquote>

<p>
If you can guess the connection, you've been reading entirely too much about early hominids!

Congratulations to Kate Wong on a really innovative idea -- they have an opportunity for other folks to contribute as well, so dive in!
