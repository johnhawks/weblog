I can't believe my #1 Google search this month is "Humanzee". I wrote about <a href="weblog/topics/history/king_kong_soviet_humanzee_2005.html">King Kong humanzee trivia</a> last month. It sure is an interesting story, about Soviet cross-species breeding programs. But I can't imagine that's driving the traffic.

<p>
There is a <a href="http://humanzee.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">band in Edinburgh named "Humanzee"</a>, but their site counter isn't much higher than my humanzee hits. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not even in the top five Google links, although <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=humanzee&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">I am on the front page</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I guess pointing this out will only increase the flow! Welcome, humanzee seekers.
