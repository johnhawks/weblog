John Wilkins is an expert on species concepts in biology; he has written a short piece for wide circulation on the topic which is archived at his blog: <a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/10/20/how-many-species-concepts-are-there/">"How many species concepts are there?"</a> I just lectured on that topic in my introductory course, and it's good to have such an accessible introduction to the topic. In this case, Wilkins focuses on the philosophy -- why are there different concepts, and what do we mean when we say that?
