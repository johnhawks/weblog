Yes, the Vancouver Olympics have a Bigfoot as a mascot. Let's see some of his interesting features: 

<blockquote>Quatchi is a young sasquatch who comes from the mysterious forests of Canada.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Quatchi is shy, but loves to explore new places and meet new friends.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although Quatchi loves all winter sports, hes especially fond of hockey. He dreams of becoming a world-famous goalie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because of his large size, he can be a little clumsy. But no one can question his passion. He knows that if he works hard and always does his best, he might one day achieve his dream.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Quatchi is always encouraging his friends to join him on journeys across Canada. He is also often recruiting others to play hockey or at least to take shots at him!</blockquote>

Hmmmm...let's hope Quatchi has the sense not to come south of the border to recruit others to "take shots" at him...
