<em>The Observer</em> has a slideshow of some of the "Ice Age Art" pieces being displayed in a temporary exhibition at the British Museum: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/gallery/2012/dec/08/ice-age-art-british-museum">"Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind  in pictures"</a>. 

The collection includes the Dolni Vestonice venus and one of the Vogelherd mammoths. The <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ice_age_art.aspx">exhibition</a> begins next month.
