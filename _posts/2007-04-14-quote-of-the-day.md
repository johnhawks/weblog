Joel Allen (1877:139), quoted in Virginie Millien and colleagues (2006):

<blockquote>The present more or less unstable condition of the circumstances surrounding organic beings, together with the known mutations of climate our planet has undergone in past geological ages, points clearly to the agency of physical conditions as one of the chief factors in the evolution of new forms of life.</blockquote>
