Matt Wedel of Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/lies-damned-lies-and-clash-of-the-dinosaurs/">relates an unfortunate story of his involvement in a dinosaur documentary</a> project.

<blockquote>Do you see, do you <i>understand</i>, what they did there? I was explaining why an old idea was WRONG and they cut away the frame and left me presenting the discredited idea like its hot new science. How freaking unethical is that? </blockquote>

The long comment thread brings out other bad dinosaur documentaries. Meanwhile, <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/clash-of-the-dinosaurs-the-discovery-channel-steps-up/">the story may have a satisfactory ending. </a>

Good thoughts therein for scientists who may get invited to help with documentary productions. <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/12/17/the-mighty-power-of-blogosaurus/">Carl Zimmer's reactions</a> are also worthwhile.
