This week's <I>Nature</i> includes a report on the sequencing of James Watson's complete genome by a new process developed by 454 Life Sciences. I just had to convey this gag-inducing quote from the news article's conclusion: 
</p>

<blockquote>James Watson is a brilliant scientist with a remarkable life story. He both laid the deep scientific foundations for genomic biology and devoted much of his life -- through his teaching, his leadership and the sheer force of his personality -- to building this science to its current productive state. Along the way, he stepped on more than one landmine. Future historians will find him a rich and elusive subject. Perhaps, informed by the advanced genetics of their day, they will scrutinize the data left behind by Wheeler et al. for clues to why he was the way he was. However, I suspect that they will have to rely instead, as historians do today, on what Watson wrote, said and did during his lifetime rather than on the order of the base pairs in his genome.</blockquote>

Oh, brother.
