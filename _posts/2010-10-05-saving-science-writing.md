<i>Wired</i> editor David Rowan wrote last week about <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/27/how-to-save-science-journalism">"How to save science journalism"</a>. It's a long essay, discussing the problems traditional media outlets have supporting dedicated science reporting, some of the approaches that are attracting readers today, and some thoughts about the future. 

I think these last fall a little flat -- the advice basically boils down to, "blog more," and "find hidden stories."
