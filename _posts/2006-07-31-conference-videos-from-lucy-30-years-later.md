<p>
Roberto Macchiarelli kindly sent along the web address for the <a href="http://webcast.in2p3.fr/lucy/index.php">webcast coverage</a> of the "Lucy, 30 ans apr&egrave;s" conference, which occurred earlier this summer in Aix en Provence. The <a href="http://www.cerege.fr/lucy30/planning_en.html">conference program</a> is also online. The videos require RealPlayer, so you'll want to get that if you want to watch them.

It's great that these talks are available on video for everyone to watch!
