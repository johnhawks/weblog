A reader says I should shamelessly plug an Amazon deal, which seems appropriate for Earth Day: For $70 they're selling a 17-DVD set called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001957A44?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001957A44">The BBC Natural History Collection</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=johnhawksanth-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001957A44" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which includes Planet Earth, Blue Planet, Life of Birds and Life of Mammals. 

Seems like a pretty good deal if you're in the market for nature films.
