In <i>Mankind Evolving</i>, 1962, p. 310: 
</p>

<blockquote>In the past the human race was always preoccupied with finding enough to eat. The ability to wring from the available food the last bit of nourishment conferred, therefore, a tremendous adaptive advantage on man, as it does no most animals. So does the ability of the camel to store in the hump on his back some of the nutriment available in times of plenty for use in times of want. Man is in this respect different from a camel in that he tends to develop his hump in a more ventral position. </blockquote>
