Next Saturday, February 9, I will be in St. Louis speaking at the Darwin Day event at Washington University: <a href="https://schoolpartnership.wustl.edu/event/2019-darwin-day-celebration/?rd=20190209">"Institute for School Partnership: 2019 Darwin Day Celebration"</a>.

<blockquote>DATE: Saturday, February 9, 2019</blockquote>
<blockquote>TIME: Registration & continental breakfast 8 am. Program 8:25 am to 1:00 pm</blockquote>
<blockquote>LOCATION: Room 202, Life Sciences Building, Washington University Danforth Campus</blockquote>

If you're in the St. Louis area and interested in evolution, it should be a great event. I'll be talking about "New discoveries and insights into our African origins".
