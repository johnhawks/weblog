I really like <a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2007/04/16/diagnosing-dostoyevskys-epilepsy/">this Neurophilosophy post</a> on Dostoyevsky's epilepsy. It's a nice piece touching on history, literature, and psychology. Autobiographical details in his novels detail his symptoms, and contemporary accounts from relatives and friends add to the story
</p>

<blockquote>According to biographical accounts, Dostoyevsky suffered no more than 10 attacks of epilepsy in the 20 years following his first seizure, whenever that may have been. Dostoyesky himself stated that his seizures began one Easter night during his exile in Siberia. He had been arrested on April 23rd, 1849, for his involvement with the Petrashevsky circle, a group of liberal intellectuals. After his arrest, Dostoyevsky was subjected to a mock execution, as a form of psychological torture, before being taken to Semipalatinsk prison in Omsk; some researchers have suggested that the trauma of the mock execution is what triggered his epilepsy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From 1860, Dostoyevsky recorded the dates of his seizures in a notebook; from that time, up to his death some 20 years later, he documented 102 seizures. This provides the researcher with precise information about the frequency of his attacks, and shows that it was not until 1857, soon after Dostoyevsky's first marriage, that his condition was unequivocally diagnosed as epilepsy.</blockquote>

I think it is a story very relevant to the nineteenth-century context, which increasingly moved toward acceptance of mysticism on the one hand, and psychological science on the other. And strange blends of the two, manifested by Freud (who makes an appearance in the post) and others.
