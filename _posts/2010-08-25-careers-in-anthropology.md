<i>The Guardian</i> has a helpful entry in its series on careers: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2010/aug/21/anthropology-degree-career-options">"What to do with a degree in anthropology."</a>

Most don't pursue graduate work: 

<blockquote>Of the anthropology graduates who left university in 2008, 51% were in employment after six months in a diverse range of careers such as advertising and sales (8%), business and finance (6%) and public or private sector management (12%). However, a large number were working in catering (15%) or in clerical roles (20%)  no doubt a reflection of the current scarcity of graduate-level jobs.</blockquote>

I think there is no degree that articulates so well with a broad range of other fields -- there are ways to combine anthropology with everything from history to engineering. That's one reason why graduates have such a broad range of careers, they're led by their interests in other fields as well.
