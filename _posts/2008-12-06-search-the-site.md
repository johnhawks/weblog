If you look to the top of the left sidebar, you'll see that I've enabled a search box. This is a pretty good search function, I've been testing it for some time. 

The search on the old system never worked very well, so I'm sure many readers didn't even notice it was gone. 

But over the past few weeks I've gotten a number of requests for info that might be found deep in the site -- now it's only a search away!
