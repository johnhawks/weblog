Thomas Mailund covers some recent modeling of the human-chimpanzee divergence: <a href="http://www.mailund.dk/index.php/2009/08/19/doubts-about-complex-speciation-between-humans-and-chimpanzees/">"Doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees"</a>. Here's the bottom line: 


<blockquote>Voil!  No more need for a complex speciation history!</blockquote>

I wrote about the initial suggestion of a "complex speciation" when it came out in 2006: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/divergence/dawn_chumans_patterson_2006.html">"The Dawn Chumans"</a> I didn't buy it then, I don't now. This is an important issue to work out, because all our estimates of the human-chimpanzee divergence time depend on the importance of lineage-sorting in the ancestral (chuman) population.
