Again from <em>Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind</em> today, Don Johanson describes his thoughts upon the question of whether to place the Hadar jaw remains (later attributed to <em>Au. afarensis</em>) in the genus <em>Homo</em>: 


<blockquote>With a kind of mental blink I acknowledged that I had arrived at the point where other anthropologists before me had arrived, where each had had to ask the old question: where did one draw the line? </blockquote>

<blockquote>I had never had to ask myself that question. I had had no fossils of my own to force it on me. Now, for the first time, I became aware of what a problem it might have been for others to draw the ancestral human thread thinner and thinner, back farther and farther, until it was not a human thread at all. This could be an emotional problem as well as a scientific one. The investigator would find himself pressing ever deeper to pass beyond the origins of man, and yet not be able to give man up. There would always be a human ancestor: a little older, a little more primitive---but still human.</blockquote>

I really like that passage. It appears immediately after Johanson recounts a long conversation with Richard Leakey, during which both ponder the significance of <em>Homo</em>-like characters and the Leakeys' discovery of the KNM-ER 1470 skull. 

To be honest, really only Louis Leakey, Phillip Tobias and John Napier had faced the same question before in the same way, with their diagnosis of <em>Homo habilis</em> in 1964. In every previous discovery, the discoverers (Dubois, Dart, Broom, Black, von Koenigswald) had <em>declined</em> to extend the thread of <em>Homo</em> into a more primitive fossil form, instead naming a new genus for each primitive hominin they found:  <em>Pithecanthropus</em>, <em>Australopithecus</em>, <em>Paranthropus</em>, <em>Sinanthropus</em>, <em>Meganthropus</em>, even <em>Zinjanthropus</em>. Leakey, Napier and Tobias for the first time deliberately extended the genus, embracing fossils with brain sizes smaller than any normal living human (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/taxonomy/leakey-tobias-napier-definition-homo-2014.html">"Leakey, Tobias, and Napier on the definition of our genus"</a>). 

In light of Johanson's later narrative, his text here might be read to criticize the Leakeys for their "emotional problem" pressing <em>Homo</em> deeper than it should really go. But I read it straight. It's a problem we inevitably face when considering the evolution of our own genus. We might cast the diagnosis of <em>Homo habilis</em> today as a radical act. <em>Homo</em> must have a beginning, one that Darwinian mechanisms will inevitably allow us to see only in a very foggy outline. 

Those of us who have been involved in the interpretation of fossils found <em>after</em> the 1970s have faced just this question, for some of the same reasons as Johanson.
