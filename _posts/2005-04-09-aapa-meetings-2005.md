Now back from the meetings, I wanted to give my sincere thanks to all those who introduced themselves and had kind words about the weblog.  I'm really glad to know that it's useful and is getting some people excited about human evolution. I keep track of the number of hits, but I can't say how much I appreciate the comments.

<p>
The e-mail rate from readers has increased recently, and I'm really happy about it. I usually take some time to answer thoughtfully, especially if it is a busy time at work or if I am out of town, or if the question can be turned into a post. So please don't be offended if I take a while to get back to you; my students actually are paying for my answers and I have to send theirs first.

I'll have some posts about things at the meetings that were interesting and thought-provoking, with a few topics that will take some research to put together good reviews. The Flores situation is beginning to induce <i>schadenfreude</i>; on that more below.
