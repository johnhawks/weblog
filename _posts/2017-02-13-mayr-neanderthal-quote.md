Ernst Mayr (1951):

<blockquote>It is very probable that additional finds will make the delimitation of <em>sapiens</em> against Neanderthal even more difficult. It seems best to follow Dobzhansky's suggestion and to consider the two forms, as well as the ancestral group that seems to combine their characters, as a single species.</blockquote>
