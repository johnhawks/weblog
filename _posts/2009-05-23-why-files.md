Alan Boyle's "Cosmic Log" <a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/05/22/1941478.aspx">is featuring UW science journalists Terry Devitt and David Tenenbaum</a>, whose website <a href="http://whyfiles.org/">"The Why Files"</a> has been reporting science online for 10 years. They have a new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114670?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143114670"><i>The Why Files: The Science Behind the News</i></a>, that presents some of their best work. The book's cover calls it the "not for nerds guide" to everything from human brains to galactic death rays. 

These guys are great participants in the UW community and after starting their site on a shoestring have had a great success with it.
