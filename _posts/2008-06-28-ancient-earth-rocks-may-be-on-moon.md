Simulations <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080626-am-earth-moon.html">have shown</a> that ejecta from ancient impacts on Earth may have landed safely on the Moon, allowing future astronauts to search for ancient traces of Earth's life forms within meteorites found on the lunar surface. 

I'm not sure whether I want them to turn up any mummified hominid parts, but I'll be happy to look at a tooth.
