From Paige Madison, a historical note on the public revelation of Raymond Dart's examination of the first australopith: <a href="https://fossilhistory.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/taung-child/">"Announcing the Taung Child to the World"</a>: 

<blockquote>The <em>Nature</em> publication was set to appear February 3, 1925. However, as the date approached, there was no word from the journal. The <em>Star</em> finally contacted <em>Nature</em> and asked about the publication date, and <em>Nature</em> replied that Dart’s claims of the missing link were so unprecedented that the paper had been sent to various experts in England for review. But the reviewers had not yet gotten back to <em>Nature</em>. The <em>Star</em> informed <em>Nature</em> that they would not withhold their release, and would publish their story as planned on February 3.</blockquote>
