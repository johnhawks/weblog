<i>The Guardian</i> has <a href="">an interview with James Gleick</a> about his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375423729/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375423729"><i>The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</i></a>. The book focuses in part on Claude Shannon and his development of information theory, which leads to one of the most interesting passages in the interview: 

<blockquote>But as you note, information is not knowledge. We are more painfully aware of that now than ever. In explaining Shannon's work I kept having to emphasise his point about the irrelevance of meaning; yet we know full well that meaning is what we really care about. This loomed larger and larger. There's a hilarious moment in 1950 in a New York hotel meeting room when Shannon tries to explain "information" to anthropologists and psychologists such as Margaret Mead and Lawrence Frank, and they're a little outraged. Where are the humans in this picture? Where are our brains? If it's just wires and transistors, who cares?</blockquote>

Oh, if I were a companion of the Doctor, this is the second place I'd like to see.
