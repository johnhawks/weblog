<p>
At the moment, there are some problems with my lab network, so I have moved the site to an alternate server. It should work fairly well, although it may take awhile for the backup address to propagate through the DNS system, and again when I switch back to the regular server.

<p>
There are some links that are not working, but the RSS feed should be up. I will be testing and updating over the next week or two, so there may be some additional downtime.

It's the first real outage here for over two years, so I guess I was due!
