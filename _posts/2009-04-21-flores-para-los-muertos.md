A reader passes this along: 

<blockquote>[I]n case you weren't aware Stony Brook is gracing the world with a sneak peak into its Hobbit discussions.  The address of their webstream is <a href="https://tlt.stonybrook.edu/webcast/Pages/default.aspx">https://tlt.stonybrook.edu/webcast/Pages/default.aspx</a>.</blockquote>

They have a number of earlier meetings archived there, so I hope they will do the same with this meeting so those of us who might like to make materials available to students will be able to do so. 

UPDATE (later): Oops -- the link was broken. Fixed now.
