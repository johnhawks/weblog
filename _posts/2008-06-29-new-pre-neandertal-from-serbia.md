Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL2768278020080627">is reporting</a> on a Middle Pleistocene find from Serbia: 

<blockquote>The fragment of a lower jaw, complete with three teeth, was discovered in a small cave in the Sicevo gorge in south Serbia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is a pre-Neanderthal jaw that we believe is between 130,000 to 250,000 years old," said Belgrade University archaeology professor Dusan Mihailovic, head of the team studying the jaw.</blockquote>

Sounds cool, but there's little in the way of relevant detail.
