Last week Lee Berger and our team announced the first series of findings from the Rising Star Expedition and subsequent analyses of the hominin fossil remains. I'll have more to write about that in the upcoming weeks, but for the time being I want to provide a link to the announcement at Maropeng in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site:

The leading dignitary at the event was the Deputy President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, whose remarks on the discovery were just wonderful. The Vice Chancellor of Wits University, Dr. Adam Habib, delivered a really thoughtful speech about the importance of open access publication for Africa. 

The presentation of <em>Homo naledi</em> begins around 40 minutes in, with short presentations by Lee Berger, myself and Paul Dirks, finishing with the unveiling of a substantial portion of the fossil collection. These fossils will be on public display at Maropeng until October 11.
