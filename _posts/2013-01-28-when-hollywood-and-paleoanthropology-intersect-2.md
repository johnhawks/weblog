A couple of weeks ago, TV's <em>Bones</em> series, which features stories inspired by forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, did an episode with a relevant plot: The FBI encounters bones dug up by an archaeologist in Chechnya, which turn out to be Ayla's family, or something thereabouts -- a family group of Neandertal, modern human, and hybrid offspring. A reader tipped me to the story, but I'm not a regular viewer of the show. Fortunately, Kristina Killgrove -- along with her excellent work in Roman bioarchaeology -- also watches and reviews episodes of <em>Bones</em>: <a href="http://www.poweredbyosteons.org/2013/01/bones-season-8-episode-11-review.html">"Bones - Season 8, Episode 11 (Review)"</a>. 

She describes the plot and applies the reality filter -- including things the writers got right, and the parts that were, well, weaker:

<blockquote>Edison said "epiphynis" for some odd reason.  He and Brennan both kept saying "<em>Homo sapien</em>" which really just annoys the crap out of me.  (Seriously, I harp on this with my students - it's <em>sapiens</em>, as it's from the Latin present participle, which ends in -ns.  Also, it's super easy to remember it has an -s at the end because literally all other major <em>Homo</em> species do: <em>H. habilis, H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis</em>, and <em>H. sapiens</em>.  For different linguistic reasons, but it makes it easy to remember!)  I could go on and on about how they kept saying "Neanderthal" rather than "Neandertal" (the latter being the preferred pronunciation today), but... yeah.  Argh.  Just.  Argh.</blockquote>

The plot twist of the creationist who funded archaeological work so that he could destroy the finds was pretty clever.
