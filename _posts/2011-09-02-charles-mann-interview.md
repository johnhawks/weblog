Razib Khan posts an interview with author Charles C. Mann, whose new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307265722/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0307265722"><i>1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created</i></a> is an account of the social and ecological effects of the Columbian exchange on the peoples of the Americas. 

<blockquote>I knew that Asians had worked under brutal conditions on the railroads. But I had no idea that something like 250,000 Asian slaves had been taken to the Americas in the 19th century. Similarly, I suspect that most Mexicans dont know that Mexico City had a thriving Chinatown by the early 1600s. And most Peruvians dont know that Asians were a significant presence in Lima as early as the 1611 census. And so on.</blockquote>

I liked his earlier book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032059/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1400032059"><i>1491</i></a> a lot, and I'll be reading the new one soon.
