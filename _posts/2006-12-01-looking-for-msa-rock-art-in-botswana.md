The Research Council of Norway has issued <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/snake-worshippers-boast-worlds-oldest-ritual-12095.html">a press release</a> about Sheila Coulson's work in the MSA of Botswana: 
</p>

<blockquote>A startling archaeological discovery this summer changes our understanding of human history. While, up until now, scholars have largely held that man's first rituals were carried out over 40, 000 years ago in Europe, it now appears that they were wrong about both the time and place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Associate Professor Sheila Coulson, from the University of Oslo, can now show that modern humans, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, have performed advanced rituals in Africa for 70,000 years. She has, in other words, discovered mankinds oldest known ritual.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>When they saw the many indentations in the rock, the archaeologists wondered about more than when the work had been done. They also began thinking about what the cave had been used for and how long people had been going there. With these questions in mind, they decided to dig a test pit directly in front of the python stone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the bottom of the pit, they found many stones that had been used to make the indentations. Together with these tools, some of which were more than 70,000 years old, they found a piece of the wall that had fallen off during the work.</blockquote>

There are no real details, but I know that some people are interested so I thought I would post. <a href="http://www.yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_46605.shtml">A story at YubaNet</a> has pictures of the "python stone" and of the points from the cave, which make up the evidence for ritual behavior: 
</p>

<blockquote>"Stone age people took these colourful spearheads, brought them to the cave, and finished carving them there. Only the red spearheads were burned. It was a ritual destruction of artifacts. There was no sign of normal habitation. No ordinary tools were found at the site. Our find means that humans were more organised and had the capacity for abstract thinking at a much earlier point in history than we have previously assumed. All of the indications suggest that Tsodilo has been known to mankind for almost 100,000 years as a very special place in the pre-historic landscape." says Sheila Coulson.</blockquote>

I can't wait to see how they know the date.
