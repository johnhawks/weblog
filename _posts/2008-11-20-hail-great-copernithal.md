OK, so <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081120/ap_on_re_eu/eu_poland_copernicus">they've identified the body of Copernicus</a>. 

<blockquote>So, in the next stage, Swedish genetics expert Marie Allen analyzed DNA from a vertebrae, a tooth and femur bone and matched and compared it to that taken from two hairs retrieved from a book that the 16th-century Polish astronomer owned, which is kept at a library of Sweden's Uppsala University where Allen works.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We collected four hairs and two of them are from the same individual as the bones," Allen said.</blockquote>

Which sort of makes you wonder about the other two hairs...

Anyway, naturally if we're going to start cloning extinct creatures, naturally we'll want to recreate the League of Extraordinary Scientists. Now, I don't know if Copernicus is going to be up to your standards; maybe you go for Newton, Einstein and Galileo first. But maybe if you want additional reinforcement that we aren't the center of the universe, you might build your Neandertal clone using a Copernican template. Although "Copernithal" sounds kind of like a pharmaceutical product of some kind.
