Last week's <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/beer-drinking-scientific-output-2008.html">story about the negative correlation between beer consumption and scientific productivity</a> has brought out the cutting crew. In <a href="http://life.lithoguru.com/index.php?itemid=119">this blog post at "Our Daily Diary,"</a> the study is skewered: 
</p>

<blockquote>But it was while I was switching to a magnificent Pacific Northwest microbrew porter that I saw the real problem. Looking at the graph of the 34 data points, it was clear that the entire correlation was caused by the five lowest-output scientists. Without those five data points, the remaining 29 - showing a wide range of scientific output and beer consumption habits - exhibited absolutely no correlation. Thus, the entire study came down to only one conclusion: the five worst ornithologists in the Czech Republic drank a lot of beer.</blockquote>

Well, that's a relief.
