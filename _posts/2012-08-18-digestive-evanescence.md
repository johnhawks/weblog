Also in <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/19/most-improbable-scientific-research-abrahams">"Strange but true: science's most improbable research"</a> includes some taphonomy:

<blockquote>If you like shrews, especially if you like them parboiled, you'll want to devour a 1994 study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Called Human Digestive Effects on a Micromammalian Skeleton, it explains how and why one of its authors  either Brian D Crandall or Peter W Stahl; we are not told which  ate and excreted a 90mm-long (excluding the tail, which added another 24mm) northern short-tailed shrew (<em>Blarina brevicauda</em>).</blockquote>

I've always been fascinated by the evidence for hyena digestion on Pleistocene faunal remains -- they crunch the bones and their stomachs etch the pieces into all manner of lozenge-like detritus. But I hadn't thought much about human shrew-eating and the total dissolution of tiny toe bones. 

Because who does think about that, really? I mean, besides zooarchaeologists.
