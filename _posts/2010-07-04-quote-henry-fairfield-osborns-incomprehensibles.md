From Henry Fairfield Osborn (1927, Proc Am Phil Soc 66:373) "Recent discoveries relating to the origin and antiquity of man."

<blockquote>Of all incomprehensible things in the universe man stands in the front rank, and of all incomprehensible things in man the supreme difficulty centers in the human brain, intelligence, memory, aspriations, and powers of discovery, research and the conquest of obstacles. </blockquote>
