<p>
John Noble Wilford has an 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/15/science/15nean.html?">article in today's New York Times</a> on the Neandertal conference. He focuses on Jim Ahern's (University of Wyoming) talk, which asked the essential question, "Did Neandertals and modern humans do it?" 
</p>

<p>
I think it's a nice treatment, although basically a puff piece. The focus on Jim nicely captures the spirit of the weekend.
