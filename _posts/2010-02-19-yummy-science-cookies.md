A reader was kind enough to forward a link to the <a href="http://notsohumblepie.blogspot.com">Not-So-Humble Pie</a> blog, written by a pseudonymous biological anthropologist and (by all appearances) phenomenal baker. The <a href="http://notsohumblepie.blogspot.com/search/label/Science">collection of science-related cookies</a> is quite awesome. 

Maybe a little skewed too much toward iced sugar cookies of various shapes, but awesome nonetheless.
