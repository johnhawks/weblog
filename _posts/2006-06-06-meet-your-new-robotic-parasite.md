One of <a href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn9283-worminspired-robot-crawls-through-intestines.html">those things</a> that says, "Please stop reading now" : 
</p>

<blockquote>Doctors currently explore the gut using endoscopes, which have to be fed through the body, or "camera pills" that must be swallowed by a patient.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A pill capable of wriggling through the gut on its own could be a valuable tool, says Andrew Gardner, an independent medical imaging expert at University College London.</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, you have to go over to <i>New Scientist</i> to see the picture. It's two tail spines short of a centipede. And it's crawling through pig guts right now. Eeeeww!
</p>

<blockquote>"If something this complicated goes wrong, it could be very hard to get out."</blockquote>

<p>
Eeeeww!
