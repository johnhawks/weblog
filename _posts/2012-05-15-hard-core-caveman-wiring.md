A story on NPR examines "social jet lag", an obscure phenomenon in which people stay up late and sleep in late on the weekends (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/05/15/152690836/jetlagged-by-your-social-calendar-better-check-your-waistline?ps=cprs">"Jet-Lagged By Your Social Calendar? Better Check Your Waistline"</a>). 

<blockquote>"Unfortunately, we have caveman's hard-core wiring," Emsellem says, "and insufficient sleep in primitive times was read by the body: <em>Danger, store fat,</em>" she says.</blockquote>

Aaaack! So toddlers and the elderly are nature's chosen people, and ... oh, I can't even finish that thought. If I read one more time about the hard-core wiring of cavemen, I'm going to unleash the Morlock horde on these people.
