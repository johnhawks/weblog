Lew Binford: What's the big deal? <a href="http://ahotcupofjoe.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/a-classic-paper-archaeology-as-anthropology/">Hot Cup of Joe</a> explores: 

<blockquote> In other, later, publications, Binford went on to refine and perfect his perspective of processual archaeology, but its my opinion that Archaeology as Anthropology was the seminal paper that first showed the glimpse of things to come. Reading it today, Binfords wisdom and the clarity of his words ring clear. There is an objective and knowable past that can be explained if the right methodology is employed.</blockquote>
