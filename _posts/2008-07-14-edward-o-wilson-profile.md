Nick Wade <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15wils.html">profiles</a> E. O. Wilson: 

<blockquote>It is through multilevel or group-level selection -- favoring the survival of one group of organisms over another -- that evolution has in Dr. Wilsons view brought into being the many essential genes that benefit the group at the individuals expense. In humans, these may include genes that underlie generosity, moral constraints, even religious behavior. Such traits are difficult to account for, though not impossible, on the view that natural selection favors only behaviors that help the individual to survive and leave more children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I believe that deep in their heart everyone working on social insects is aware that the selection that created them is multilevel selection," Dr. Wilson said.</blockquote>

Also some hints about his upcoming novel. Not sure it sounds very compelling, but who knows?
