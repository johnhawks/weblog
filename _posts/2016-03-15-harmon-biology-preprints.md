Oh, look -- I'm in the <em>New York Times</em> today, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/asap-bio-biologists-published-to-the-internet.html?smid=tw-share">this great article by Amy Harmon on the increasing adoption of preprints by biologists</a>: 

<blockquote>And many #ASAPbio supporters retweeted John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Wisconsin, who found himself recently at an African university where a paper on African genomes was unavailable because it could not pay the fee for the journal where it was published, and no preprint was available. He expressed his frustration with a profanity.</blockquote>

Yep. Proud of that one. Although my profanity is pretty milquetoast, just a "WTF?!"
