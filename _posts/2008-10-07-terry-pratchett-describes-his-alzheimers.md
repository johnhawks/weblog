I know many readers are fans of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, as I am. He has a long, heartfelt article about his experiences with PCA, a type of early-onset Alzheimer's. An excerpt:

<blockquote>When in Paradise Lost Miltons Satan stood in the pit of hell and raged at heaven, he was merely a trifle miffed compared to how I felt that day. I felt totally alone, with the world receding from me in every direction and you could have used my anger to weld steel. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Only my family and the fact I had fans in the medical profession, who gave me useful advice, got me through that moment. I feel very sorry for, and angry on behalf of, the people who dont have the easy ride I had. </blockquote>
