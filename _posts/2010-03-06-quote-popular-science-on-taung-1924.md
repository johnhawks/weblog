A reader passes along a link to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/archives">the <i>Popular Science</i> archive</a>, now available free. 

So naturally, I searched immediately for <i>"Australopithecus"</i>. And in the April 1925 issue, they covered Raymond Dart's discovery at Taung. The short article appears on the same page as a picture of an early tanning bed (complete with topless woman) and a rather short Javan man standing next to a rather tall <i>Titan arum</i> flower. Here's one of the five paragraphs:


<blockquote>The difference between men and animals is associated with the size of certain parts of the brain. The Pithecanthropus, the oldest man known, from the shape of a skull found, is judged to have been a creature who could speak. Judging again from the shape of its skull, Professor Dart says that the newly discovered manlike ape could not yet speak, but had a brain much more developed than that of an ape. That is, the brain was enlarged in those parts associated with human characteristics.</blockquote>

Isn't it remarkable how much more information articles about human evolution pack in today?


Hmmm...why did I never get into <i>Popular Science</i> when I was a kid? Here's a clue: after 1925, <i>"Australopithecus"</i> doesn't appear in the archive again until 1993!
