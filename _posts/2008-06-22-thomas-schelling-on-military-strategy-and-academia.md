Thomas Schelling, on page 8 of his <i>The Strategy of Conflict</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674840313?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067484031">Amazon</a>): 

<blockquote>Within the universities, military strategy in this country has been the preoccupation of a small number of historians and political scientists, supported on a scale htat suggests that deterring the Russians from a conquest of Europe is about as important as enforcing the antitrust laws. </blockquote>

<i>Strategy of Conflict</i> was first published in 1960, and clearly matters changed by the second edition in 1980. By the time I was an undergraduate, I took a course in international politics from an old warhorse of a political scientist, who introduced me to game theory, mutually assured destruction, and the other fundamentals of Schelling's theses.
