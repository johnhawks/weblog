<blockquote>Dear Dr. Hawks,

In case you don't already know, the current issue of Science has 2 articles on the Denisovans:

Who Were the Denisovans?

A Denisovan Legacy in the Immune System?
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6046/1086.summary

Also, their podcast discusses what is covered in the issue:

Have a wonderful night!</blockquote>

You'll see I make a brief appearance in the article, and I'll be writing more about the site and my trip there in the next few weeks. Hope everything's going well with you!
