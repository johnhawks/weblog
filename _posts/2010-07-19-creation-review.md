John Wilkins saw the film <i>Creation</i> and enters <a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/07/18/creation-a-personal-reflection-on-the-movie/">a review</a>, which I link because it's thoughtful and balanced: 

<blockquote>I am very pleasantly surprised how well it worked as a film, as well as how effectively it represented the era. My quibbles are just that, quibbles. Mostly, the history was good (despite the famous tree diagram being shown as a sheet and not a page in the Notebooks), but the overall dramatic themes are just wrong.</blockquote>
