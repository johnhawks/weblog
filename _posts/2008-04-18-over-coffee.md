<b>John:</b> I got the strangest e-mail today. It was from the University -- they wanted me to fill out "an important survey from Homeland Security."
</p>

<p>
<b>Gretchen:</b> Uhh...that sounds odd...
</p>

<p>
<b>J:</b> Yeah. So I clicked on the survey, and it asks me, "Does your laboratory use or store any dangerous chemicals?" Well, I clicked "No." And then, "Does your laboratory have any laser equipment?" And you know, I'm totally thinking like sharks with laser beams, right? But I clicked "No." And then it was, "Does your laboratory use biological agents?" So, I clicked "No," and it was like, "Thank you for your responses," and that was the end of it! I mean, you'd think they could do a little background, and sort of rule out the anthropologists!
</p>

<p>
<b>G:</b> Yes, like you're going to reconstitute <i>Gigantopithecus</i> and make it into your big dumb lackey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J: </b> Oooh -- if you're going to choose between a few big dumb lackeys or a lot of little dumb ones, which do you pick? I mean, I categorically rule out smart lackeys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>G:</b> Because they will rise against you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J:</b> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>G:</b> So you want me to choose between Bigfoots or Oompa-loompas? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J:</b> I guess that sort of answers itself. I mean, if you are going to send them into the basement to get something, you'd pick the Oompa-loompas, since you don't have to worry about their heads hitting the door frame. 
</p>

<p>
<b>G:</b> Right. And you know if you send Bigfoot down there, he's going to dump in the corner or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J:</b> Uh, yeah. That would be bad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>G:</b> So if I'm going to have henchmen or minions, I'd rather have many minions than a few henchmen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J:</b> Yes, clearly Homeland Security is wasting their time with us!
</p>
