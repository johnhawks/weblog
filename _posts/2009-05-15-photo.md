Today's photo:

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/nail_in_tree_macro_2009.jpg" height="400" width="266" alt="Nail in tree" />
</div>

Hmmm....a crocodile's eye? No, it's a rusty nail in a knot of our spruce tree. Who knows how long it's been there. 

55 mm macro extender, f/8 ISO 400.
