I've enabled the search function for the site, which you'll find at top right on each page of the site. The search index is still rebuilding, and as I write this has only indexed 4% of the site. That brings it up to late 2007, and it's interesting to go back through the history of paleoanthropology that way.

For example, I ran across my comments (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/lower/phylogenetics/wilford_early_homo_2007.html">"Is a lack of fossils the problem with early Homo?"</a>) on a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/science/18evol.html">John Noble Wilford piece from four years ago</a>. Seems very timely in many ways. For example, the paucity of the fossil record of <i>Homo</i> before 1.6 million years ago was a major feature of the article. I directed my attention to the supposed "gap" between 3 and 2 million years ago: 

<blockquote>[W]e actually have quite a lot of fossils from this time period. The entire South African <i>A. africanus</i> fossil record, with the exception of a few early specimens like STW 573, come from this "gap." A fairly extensive record of the appearance and evolution of early robust australopithecines comes from this time period in East Africa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And, here and there, a few specimens look Homo-like. Wilford's article discusses AL 666-1. To this we can add the Uraha mandible, Omo 75-14, an additional series of teeth from Omo, and possibly the Bouri BOU-VP 35/1 skeleton.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Properly considered, the rarity of early <i>Homo</i> in these contexts is not a <i>problem</i>; it is <i>information</i>. </blockquote>

Of course, dates have changed. We now have good dates for Dmanisi, which make those fossils the earliest well-attested <i>Homo erectus</i> sample at 1.8 million years. STW 573 now looks late, not early. But the fact remains that people were looking for pure representatives of <i>Homo</i> in the fragments instead of exploring morphological diversity within the large and fairly complete samples at hand.
