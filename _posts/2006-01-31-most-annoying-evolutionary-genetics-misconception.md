I happened into a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/01/cfp_least_favorite_misconcepti_1.php">post on Uncertain Principles</a> soliciting candidates for "Most annoying misconception about your field". The choice there was the nature of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

<p>
RPM at Evolgen <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/01/chad_is_my_muse.php">posted an annoying genetics misconception</a>, namely: 
</p>

<blockquote>the idea that by sequencing a genome, we are "decoding" it</blockquote>

<p>
Personally, I think this would be a great topic for a meetings panel. I can think of about fifty really annoying misconceptions. The nature of these two seems especially science-fiction-y -- the sort of thing that people generally knowledgeable about science sort of understand to be true or meaningful. 
</p>

<p>
On that level, I would nominate the one-gene, one-trait fallacy -- the idea that every trait is encoded by one gene. From this we have the popular idea that you can discover a gene "for" something. Of course, the usual case is that you discover a gene with a particularly bad allele in some people with a genetic disorder. But that generally gives little clue about what the gene does, or what its evolutionary history might be. 
</p>

<p>
But that isn't actually the one that annoys the most. 
</p>

<p>
Instead, I am most annoyed by the idea that <i>genetic divergence and species divergence are the same</i>. That fallacy underlies the long literature on the 5-million-year divergence date for chimpanzees and humans. 
</p>

<p>
Set aside for a moment the fact that the species divergence must be at least old enough to encompass the earliest fossil hominids (now, around 6 million years old or so). The real problem is that two newly-isolated populations are not genetically uniform -- each of them has variation and the two overlap to some extent. The date of genetic divergence between alleles taken from each of the populations <i>at the time of their isolation</i> is a function of the demographic and selection histories in their common ancestor population. 
</p>

<p>
So genetic divergence must always precede species divergence. That period of time probably ranges from a few hundred thousand to several million years before the time of species divergence. 
</p>

<p>
It's an important problem in the human-chimpanzee case, since the 5-million-year <i>genetic</i> divergence would correspond to a younger <i>species</i> divergence. Genetics are even more out of tune with the fossils than most people usually assume. (The problem is likely in accurately estimating the rate of genetic changes.)
</p>

<p>
And it's always annoying to see that 5-million-year figure repeated endlessly when, not only does it have to be wrong, it shouldn't have even been applicable in the first place.
