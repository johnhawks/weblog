The Madison "Blue Sky Science" series of Q and A got me to answer a reader's question: <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/print_only/ask-us/bluesky/blue-sky-science-how-do-we-identify-new-species-from/article_927f14c8-b992-5070-b406-84f1acd7a1d9.html">"How do we identify new species from fossils?"</a> 

That question could lead to a very long answer! This is a nice 2-minute version that makes reference to our recent work identifying <em>Homo naledi</em>. It's a short feature in the Monday edition of the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> as well.
