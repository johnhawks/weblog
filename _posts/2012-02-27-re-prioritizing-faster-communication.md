Two experts on social policy from the London School of Economics <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/02/24/five-minutes-patrick-dunleavy-chris-gilson/">comment on the importance of blogging and public outreach for academics</a>, in an interview reporting the startup of a new public policy blog.
 
<blockquote>One of the recurring themes (from many different contributors) on the Impact of Social Science blog is that a new paradigm of research communications has grown up  one that de-emphasizes the traditional journals route, and re-prioritizes faster, real-time academic communication in which blogs play a critical intermediate role. They link to research reports and articles on the one hand, and they are linked to from Twitter, Facebook and Google+ news-streams and communities.  So in research terms blogging is quite simply, one of the most important things that an academic should be doing right now.</blockquote>
