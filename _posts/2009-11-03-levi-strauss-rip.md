Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33606794/ns/technology_and_science-science/">has died</a>, and the obituary tells me this: 

<blockquote>France reacted emotionally to Levi-Strauss' weekend death, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy joining government officials, politicians and ordinary citizens populating blogs with heartfelt tributes.</blockquote>

Times certainly have changed, if "populating blogs" is how people deal with loss. For all you grief-stricken readers out there, take heart! 

UPDATE (2009/11/04): <a href="http://www.cognitionandculture.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=538:scott-atrans-memories-of-levi-strauss&catid=67:scott-atrans-blog&Itemid=34">Scott Atran's remembrance of L&eacute;vi-Strauss</a> is well-worth reading. A short quote: 

<blockquote>I imagine myself in the New World with Columbus for the first time, he mused, a symphony of sounds, of colors, of smells, of desires, and of hopes. Then I imagine myself on the moon with the astronauts, and all I see is gray, dust and barren rocks, and the earth I long for is far out of reach.</blockquote>
