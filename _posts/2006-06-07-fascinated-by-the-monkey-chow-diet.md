Is it so wrong that my guilty pleasure this week is reading <a href="http://www.angryman.ca/blog/angryblog.html">this man's diary</a> of his experiment in eating <i>only monkey chow?</i>

<blockquote>I'm tired of cooking. I hate scrubbing pots and pans. I've wasted too much time in the checkout line. It's time to eat chow.</blockquote>

<p>
What is fascinating is that the thing clearly would have ended already, except that people started blogging about it! Now the frustration with the chow is competing with the allure of attention. How much does the attention have to wane before he gives it up?
