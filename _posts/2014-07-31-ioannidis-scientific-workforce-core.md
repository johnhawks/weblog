I've had this link on my desktop for a while, a paper by John Ioannidis and colleagues in <em>PLoS ONE</em>: <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0101698">"Estimates of the Continuously Publishing Core in the Scientific Workforce"</a>. 

<blockquote>Using the entire Scopus database, we estimated that there are 15,153,100 publishing scientists (distinct author identifiers) in the period 1996â€“2011. However, only 150,608 (<1%) of them have published something in each and every year in this 16-year period (uninterrupted, continuous presence [UCP] in the literature). This small core of scientists with UCP are far more cited than others, and they account for 41.7% of all papers in the same period and 87.1% of all papers with >1000 citations in the same period. Skipping even a single year substantially affected the average citation impact. </blockquote>

I'm not in the 1%, since I didn't start publishing regularly until 2000. Indeed, anyone who began or ended their career in this 15-year-period is likely to be absent (although career-enders might still have papers in the pipeline to keep them on the annual-publishing list). 

But this is actually very remarkable, that you can differentiate people by whether they publish at least once a year, every year, and the resulting list of people makes up more than 40% of all papers. It speaks to the multi-authored papers that have become so important in most of the sciences. With multi-author lists in mind, it's less surprising that the same list would include so many of the papers with 1000 citations or more.
