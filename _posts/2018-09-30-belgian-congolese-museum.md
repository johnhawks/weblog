National Public Radio (U.S.) has a story about one of the evils of Belgian colonization of the Congo: King Leopold brought hundreds of Congolese to Belgium to live in a mock African village for public display: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/649600217/where-human-zoos-once-stood-a-belgian-museum-now-faces-its-colonial-past?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20180930">"Where 'Human Zoos' Once Stood, A Belgian Museum Now Faces Its Colonial Past"</a>.

The site near Tervuren is now part of the current grounds of the Royal Museum for Central Africa. As the story details, it wasn't a one-off:

<blockquote>Fifty years later, Belgium built another mock African village at the 1958 Brussels world's fair. The Congolese who traveled to Belgium for the exposition thought it would be a cultural exchange, says Zana Etambala, a historian at the Royal Museum for Central Africa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Instead, they found themselves standing behind a bamboo fence, on live display for Europeans, some of whom made monkey noises to get their attention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"They were throwing bananas and peanuts to [the Congolese]," says Etambala, who grew up in Belgium and Congo. "And the Congolese protested against that. They wanted to be respected and not seen as animals in a zoo."</blockquote>

The Royal Museum today is undergoing a renovation that will bring some of the horrific stories of colonial abuses into the public displays.
