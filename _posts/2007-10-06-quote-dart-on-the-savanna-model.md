Raymond Dart (p. 198 of <i>Australopithecus africanus</i>, the man-ape of South Africa, <i>Nature</i> 115:195-199, 1925), summing up why hominids might have lived in what seemed "harsh and forbidding" environments for a primate:

For the production of man a different apprenticeship was needed to sharpen the wits and quicken the higher manifestations of intellect -- a more open veldt country where competition was keener between swiftness and stealth, and where adroitness of thinking and movement played a preponderating role in the preservation of the species. Darwin has said, "no country in the world abounds in a greater degree with dangerous beasts than Southern Africa," and, in my opinion, Southern Africa, by providing a vast open country with occasional wooded belts and a relative scarcity of water, together with a fierce and bitter mammalian competition, furnished a laboratory such as was essential to this penultimate phase of human evolution.</blockquote>
