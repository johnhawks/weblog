A new Kickstarter-funded documentary is coming out about Dr. John Brinkley, the Kansas quack best known for his goat gland operations during the Roaring Twenties and into the Great Depression. The film is <a href="http://www.nutsthefilm.com/#nuts"><em>Nuts!</em></a>. It seems to take an unusual approach, at first going into the story with a sympathetic view to the doctor, through animated reenactments, then exposing him as a huckster. 

Andrew Lapin of <em>National Geographic</em> has an interview of the film's director, Penny Lane: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/documentary-interview-medicine-science/">"The Bizarre History of a Bogus Doctor Who Prescribed Goat Gonads"</a>. Of course, there is the question that everyone asks: What exactly was the operation? 

<blockquote>So he just kind of stuck it in there under the skin, and if you were the patient, you could feel there was something in there. And if the surgery worked at all, that was the secret to it: that you knew youâ€™d had it, and you were told that it worked. It was the power of suggestion.</blockquote>

It's not really very far from things we see advertised today. Just tonight we were listening to the radio and heard an ad for a product: "It won't bring you back to what you used to be, it will make you more of a man than you ever were!" 

This is a part of history I love, being a native Kansan myself. As the American Medical Association tried to put an end to his goat gland operations, he made a serious run at the Kansas governorship, starting a media empire in radio in the progress. Then, when the government shut down his nationwide radio station, he moved it across the border, starting the phenomenon of "Mexican radio", super high-powered stations that could beam their signal across the continent. 


The 2009 book that inspired the film was <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307339890/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307339890&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkId=a0636c0753635924edd9f72a4d904790"><em>Charlatan: America's Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam</em><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=johnhawksanth-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0307339890" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></a>, by Pope Brock. I really enjoyed this book, and if you want a very readable account of this history, I strongly recommend it.
