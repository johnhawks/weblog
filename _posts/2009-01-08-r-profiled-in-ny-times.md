If you do much statistics and haven't worked with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, you should try it out. The <i>NY Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">profiled the software</a> yesterday: 

<blockquote>R is similar to other programming languages, like C, Java and Perl, in that it helps people perform a wide variety of computing tasks by giving them access to various commands. For statisticians, however, R is particularly useful because it contains a number of built-in mechanisms for organizing data, running calculations on the information and creating graphical representations of data sets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>What makes R so useful  and helps explain its quick acceptance  is that statisticians, engineers and scientists can improve the softwares code or write variations for specific tasks. Packages written for R add advanced algorithms, colored and textured graphs and mining techniques to dig deeper into databases.</blockquote>

The graphs are pretty, and it's free software. The article describes it as a "lingua franca" for grad students. Maybe not, but I wouldn't invest my time learning anything <i>less</i> powerful.
