A reader wrote me today: 

<blockquote>I am wondering if you could suggest a general article for me to give to people who tell me how exited they are about sending a cheek swab to National Geographic for analysis.  I imagine you have written something like this, but don't remember where it is. Any thoughts?</blockquote>

I wrote back, and thought I should share. I have an article in Slate from a couple of years ago that covers that topic:

http://www.slate.com/id/2138059/

Also, there was a NY Times article in late 2007 that basically covers the same difficulties:

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/business/25dna.html

I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/race/genetic_ancestry/times_testing_troubles_nixon_2007.html">blogged about that article</a> at the time. I also have a <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/site/slate_dna_genealogy_article_2006.html">post from the time of the <i>Slate</i> article</a>. 

And my <a href="http://johnhawks.net/taxonomy/term/118">"testing" tag</a> leads to a bunch of posts on the topic of genetic testing. I've never really sat down to write an FAQ on the topic, but I think it would be worth doing. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/">Genetic Future</a> does a very good job of covering current commercial offerings in genetic testing, a beat also covered at <a href="http://www.eyeondna.com/">Eye on DNA</a>.

If someone was thinking of sending $100 to Genographic, I have nothing against it as a form of entertainment. I think the information you get that way is, for most people, very superficial and unsurprising. Basically, they're giving you your paternal Y chromosome lineage if you're a man, and your mtDNA if you're a woman. That fee pays for your test, the information they give out to you as a participant, and an extra amount that they will use to subsidize testing of various populations around the world. 

But if you're looking for the entertainment value, you will be <b>much</b> better off saving up $400 to send to 23andMe. That pays for a whole-genome SNP survey, including various phenotype predictions. They have all the genealogical information from the Y and mtDNA that you would get from Genographic, and it's better-presented. Overall, it's a much better deal, and more likely to generate something interesting to share with your friends. Of course, it costs more, but it's a better value. 

Now, for serious medical purposes, or for trying to do phenotype predictions of your children, I don't recommend 23andMe. I honestly think that gene testing now is best treated as expensive entertainment. You might get a laugh, or learn something about your ancestry that you didn't know. But you won't likely learn anything that would be worthwhile to your children. Not yet, anyway. This is not an investment.

<b>In other words, don't spend your food money</b>. Think of it as eight months of cable TV.
