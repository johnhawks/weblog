Travis Pickering and colleagues have a paper presenting new teeth from Swartkrans, which they attribute to <em>Paranthropus robustus</em>: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.08.005">"New early Pleistocene hominin teeth from the Swartkrans Formation, South Africa"</a>. I'm pointing to the paper because it has a long and clear review of the complex history of site formation in this ancient cave.
