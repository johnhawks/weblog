As you can see, the site has changed! I've moved to a new server, and I've taken the opportunity to move to a new content management system along with it. I've been running the new site as a shadow for a while, and everything ought to work (although there will be some funny-looking things here are there). Almost all permalinks to the site will still work. 

I'll have some more details about the move and some of the new features that it should enable me to build. In the meantime, please notice my new affiliate links on the right side of the page. I won't be having any pledge drives or advertising anytime soon, but if you're buying a book anyway remember that you can direct a percentage to support this site.
