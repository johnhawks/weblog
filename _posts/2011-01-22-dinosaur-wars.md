Brian Switek <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/scientists-clash-in-dinosaur-wars/">reviews the American Experience program, <i>Dinosaur Wars</i></a>, which covered the scientific rivalry between paleontologists Othniel Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. We watched it this week, I love it when AE takes a science-related subject. It does this way too rarely considering the importance of science and technology to American history. 

Without doing a full review, it was a good show. I liked it when Thomas Henry Huxley showed up to visit. 

I just wish I knew someone with the middle name of "Drinker."
