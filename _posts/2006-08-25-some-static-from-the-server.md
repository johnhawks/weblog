I had some hiccups here at the lab; they seem to be upgrading the building network, which is causing some downtime. I've generated a backup site, which breaks some of the links, but this problem gets smaller as I work with it.

<p>
If I go to the backup again, it should be essentially transparent now, although the site will be served from static pages, so the search form won't be working.

In the meantime, I am back online with the regular server. Before this week it had been two years without a significant outage, so I'm very happy -- although this is a tough week for it to break down!
