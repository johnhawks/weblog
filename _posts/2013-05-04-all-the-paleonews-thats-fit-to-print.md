The <em>New York Times</em> joins the Neandertal anti-defamation league with an editorial by David Frayer: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/opinion/global/Who-Are-You-Calling-a-Neanderthal.html">"Whore You Calling a Neanderthal?"</a>. 

<blockquote>Neanderthals lived much richer lives than ever presumed. They were not exactly like us, but they bred with us and their genes and behavior are part of our heritage. So, be careful when you call someone a Neanderthal. Youre speaking about part of yourself.</blockquote>

Frayer covers many of the last 5 years of discoveries of Neandertal cultural complexity, as well as the genetics. Now if only the newspaper would rein in Maureen Dowd, who has been one of the media's most frequent Neandertal-bashers.
