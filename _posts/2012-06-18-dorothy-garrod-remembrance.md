Cambridge has produced an article about the accomplishments of archaeologist Dorothy Garrod, the first female professor in the institution: <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Education-and-Training/Higher-Education/The-groundbreaking-female-archaeologist-14062012.htm">"The groundbreaking female archaeologist"</a>. 

<blockquote>Fingers drummed, heads scratched, because for all the universitys failings on sexual equality, they were eager to have her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The solution?</blockquote>

<blockquote>They turned her into a man, hoots Dr Pamela Jane Smith, a research fellow at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at Cambridge, a 68-year-old academic whose PhD thesis resurrected Garrods accomplishments from the dusty folds of history.</blockquote>

Garrod is remembered in paleoanthropology as the excavator of Skhul and Tabun, along with many other important sites.
