Writer Corey Kilgannon in the <i>NY Times</i> writes about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/arts/14reun.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=5bf3d660273829c4&ex=1331524800&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">a "DNA reunion:"</a>
</p>

<blockquote>Ms. Higginsen, who runs a school for gospel singers in the brownstone, had organized this special family reunion to welcome to Harlem a newfound cousin she recently discovered through DNA testing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And in walked the new cousin: a Missouri cattle rancher named Marion West, 76. It was Mr. West's first visit to New York City, and he stood out partly because of his rancher outfit: black cowboy hat, shiny boots, string tie and a jacket advertising a feed company. But he also stood out because he was a white man greeted by a roomful of black New Yorkers embracing him as a long-lost member of their family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He brought laughter to the room when he spoke of cattle breeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I've been breeding cattle all my life, and I'll tell you, cross-breeding is better," he said. "You mate the black angus with the other breeds, and you have better, healthier offspring."</blockquote>

<p>
I can think of no better way to illustrate that this kind of genetic testing is going mainstream.
