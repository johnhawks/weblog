I've been unusually busy this holiday week, and haven't had much time to sit down and write. A reader sent me this death notice for the longest-lived chimpanzee on record: 

<blockquote><a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45804175/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals/#.TvyWX5iHfdl">Cheetah the chimp from 1930s Tarzan flicks dies</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The chimp was unusually long-lived, surviving beyond both Weissmuller and Maureen OSullivan, who played Tarzans mate Jane in many of the early films. Chimpanzees live an average of 35 to 45 years in captivity. Guinness World Records cited Cheetah as the worlds oldest non-human primate.</blockquote>

There is some confusion over which films this particular chimpanzee acted the part. 

<blockquote>Many chimpanzees have played Tarzans simian sidekick over the franchises long run in both films and television. The Cheetah who died Dec. 24 is not the one who appeared in the first two Weissmuller films, Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and Tarzan and His Mate (1934), but is thought to have played the role in the 1930s and 40s.</blockquote>
