The most <strong>distal</strong> teeth are molars. Most humans have three molars, but many &mdash; especially in America &mdash; have their third molars (called <strong>wisdom teeth</strong>) extracted. Some people do not develop third molars at all, or they never erupt into occlusion. Molars have three or more cusps, and are used as grinding teeth. 


The upper molars are typically labeled with superscript numbers M<sup>1</sup>, M<sup>2</sup>, and M<sup>3</sup>, the lowers with subscript numbers M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub>. Hence, the left lower first molar becomes LM<sub>1</sub>. 


Teeth have different directional terminology, referring specifically to the tooth row and the mouth. The direction toward the center front of the tooth row is <strong>mesial</strong>, and toward the rear of the tooth row is <strong>distal</strong>. For molars and premolars, the direction toward the cheek is <strong>buccal</strong>, and in toward the tongue is <strong>lingual</strong>.

The two incisors, one canine, two premolars and three molars on both top and bottom are called the human <strong>dental formula</strong>. We write a dental formula as follows:
