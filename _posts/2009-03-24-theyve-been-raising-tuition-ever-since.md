The <i>Telegraph</i> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5032354/Charles-Darwins-personal-finances-revealed-in-new-find.html">reports on Darwin's college account ledger</a>: 

<blockquote>Darwin's college bills amounted to 636.0.91/2 over three years - not including 14 he paid for his BA degree in 1831 and 12 he spent collecting an MA in 1836.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The books also contain accounts for the barber, chimney-sweep, apothecary [pharmacist], porter, brazier [who looked after the fires], glazier, hatter, laundress, linen-draper and painter, among others.</blockquote>

Linen-draper? Gee, nowadays you just go to Target at the beginning of the year. 

<blockquote>University officials said some details of Darwin's life - including how much he spent on alcohol or on having his horse stabled remained unknown.</blockquote>

Well, with such giant gaps in our knowledge, how can we even be sure Darwin existed?
