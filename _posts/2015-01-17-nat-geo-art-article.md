_National Geographic_ dedicated part of its January 2015 issue to the origin of art. The longread article by Chip Walter is now available online: <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/first-artists/walter-text">"First Artists"</a>. The narrative winds through Chauvet Cave in France, to Klipdrift Shelter in South Africa and Hohle Fels in Germany, talking with Francesco d'Errico, Nicholas Conard, Chris Henshilwood, and Jean Clottes. 

It's unfortunate that this article was written before the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/archaeology/lower/trinil-shell-engraving-2014.html">recent discovery of much earlier geometric marks from Trinil, Indonesia</a>. Indeed, the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/art/gait-art-history-eveleth-2014.html">evidence that Leang Barugayya 2, Sulawesi, exceeds the European cave art in age</a> tends to show how Eurocentric the investigation of ancient art has been.
