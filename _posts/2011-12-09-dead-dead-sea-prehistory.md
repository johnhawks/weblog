Emily Sohn reports on a drilling project that is bringing to light ancient drying episodes in the Dead Sea basin: <a href="http://news.discovery.com/earth/dead-sea-biblical-events-111208.html">"A dry Dead Sea before biblical times"</a>. 

<blockquote>At a level corresponding with 120,000 years ago, during a warm period between ice ages, the researchers found a layer of small round pebbles sitting on top of 45 meters (nearly 150 feet) of thick salt deposits. Those pebbles, they announced this week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, look just like the rocks that normally appear on the lake's beaches -- suggesting that one of the deepest parts of the lake was once dry.</blockquote>

Information about human occupation of the Levant and Arabian peninsula is getting crowded between 120,000 and 100,000 years ago. A total drying of the Jordan basin around the last interglacial would make things very interesting. Imagine the ancient artifacts on those beaches encased in meters of salt under the brine.
