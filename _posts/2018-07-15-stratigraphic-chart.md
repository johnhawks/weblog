The <a href="http://www.stratigraphy.org">International Commission on Stratigraphy</a> has released the 2018 version of Earth's stratigraphic intervals, illustrated with <a href="http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2018-07.pdf">a very helpful chart</a>:

The original, in PDF format, is easily blown up to look at the dates for each interval.
