The canine teeth in humans range from pointy-shaped to incisor-like in shape. There is only one canine in each quadrant, and it is the third tooth just distal to the incisors.

Upper canines are often denoted UC and lower canines are then LC (so that the left lower canine is LLC. 

In many other primates, the canine teeth project out far beyond the others. There is often a large space, or \term{diastema} between the upper canine and the lateral incisor. For many species, the canine teeth are the largest difference between male and female skulls. 

This station has the skulls of several kinds of primates. Measure the height of the right canine tooth in each maxillary dentition. This measurement is taken from the tip of the canine to the base of its enamel. 

Then measure the breadth of the first molar. 

Your assignment is to make a plot showing how canine height relates to molar breadth in this sample of primates. Are there any outliers in your plot? 



Are there any other features of the mandibles that seem to correlate with canine breadth?
