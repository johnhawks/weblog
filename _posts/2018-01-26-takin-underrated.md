This is a fun article on an underappreciated mammal: <a href="https://blog.nature.org/science/2018/01/22/meet-the-takin-the-largest-mammal-youve-never-heard-of/">"Meet the Takin: The Largest Mammal You’ve Never Heard Of"</a>.

<blockquote>The takin is adapted to its mountainous environment in Asia. While its range includes many countries – including parts of India, Bhutan and Myanmar – most naturalists and hard-core mammal watchers encounter the species in China. Strangely enough, there it shares its range with one of the most beloved and well-known of large mammals, the giant panda. In fact, one of the first documented instances of a giant panda eating meat is trail camera footage of one of the fuzzy critters noshing on a takin carcass.</blockquote>

The fossil record of takin in China goes back to the Pliocene, with a number of fossil representatives in the Pleistocene of central China.
