Matthew Cobb writes about <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/the-tracks-of-a-ghost/">the Devonian tetrapod trackway story</a>, including: 

<blockquote>Swedish paleontologist Per Ahlberg, who helped guide the discovery into the pages of Nature, writes: Niedzwiedzki made his amazing finding by looking in the wrong place (everyone knew that the tetrapod transition to land took place at another time, in different kinds of rocks): If youre thinking of applying to a research council for a grant to do that, you are virtually certain to be turned down. But you need to have the opportunity to do what might seem to be crazy things. Its only by doing this kind of stuff that wildly unexpected things can be discovered.</blockquote>
