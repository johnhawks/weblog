Karen Kelsky gives more advice on how to navigate graduate school to get the job you want: <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-Is-a-Means-to/131316/">"Graduate school is a means to a job".</a>

<blockquote>Never forget this primary rule: Graduate school is not your job; graduate school is a means to the job you want. Do not settle in to your graduate department like a little hamster burrowing in the wood shavings. Stay alert with your eye always on a national stage, poised for the next opportunity, whatever it is: to present a paper, attend a conference, meet a scholar in your field, forge a connection, gain a professional skill.</blockquote>
