Technical issues caused me to miss lecture 12, which was about metaphyses and the growth of the skeleton, as cues for life history evolution. 

Lecture 13 went into "Milk" as a topic. Lactase persistence comes in at the end as a case of gene-culture coevolution. Most of the lecture covers the concept of energy expenditure, including sex differences in basal metabolic rate and energy expenditure and the energy demands of pregnancy and lactation.
