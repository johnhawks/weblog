It is really not worth looking at, but I couldn't stop laughing, so I have to point it out. The <a href="www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/">Journey of Mankind</a> site is an animated map and timeline of people originating in a suburb of Nairobi 150,000 years ago, and then spreading through the world. You can follow the trip with a moving arrow, like in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Of course the whole thing is silly, but the fun really begins when the initial foray into the Levant fails ("A global freeze-up turned this area and north Africa into extreme desert"), and Cavalli-Sforza's "beachcomber" hypothesis kicks in. 
</p>

<p>
The part that had me rolling was when the red arrow of beachcombers wanders aimlessly around Borneo: 
</p>

<blockquote>From Sri Lanka they continued along the Indian Ocean coast to western Indonesia, then a landmass attached to Asia. Still following the coast they moved around Borneo to South China. </blockquote>

<p>
Yeah, that would be the way I would choose, too. 
</p>

<p>
Then Mt. Toba erupts! The world is plunged into volcanic winter, and the arrow is cut off in South Asia. You see, the volcanic ash covered it up. Without a trace. I can't make this stuff up. 
</p>

<p>
When I clicked on it I assumed it was connected with Spencer Wells' work (<i>Journey of Man</i>), but actually it was compiled by <a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/stephenoppenheimer/stephen-oppenheimer.html">Stephen Oppenheimer</a>. He's the author of <i>Out of Eden</i>, upon which the BBC based its documentary "The Real Eve." He also proposes that the sinking of the Sunda continent eradicated the origin of rice agriculture and led to a cultural exodus that became or stimulated the Polynesians, Harappans, Chinese, and others.
</p>

<p>
This is what we get when there is not enough critical science of human dispersals. We're not seeing history here, we're making it up. 
</p>

<p>
And selling books.
