<i>Gigantopithecus blacki</i> was, as its name implies, a gigantic ape from the Pleistocene of China. Its remains consist only of teeth and jaws, but these are of a tremendous size, with the largest specimens nearly twice the dimensions of male gorilla teeth and jaws. A similar, slightly smaller jaw is known from the Miocene of northern India, and has been called <i>Gigantopithecus bilaspurensis</i> <bib>Simons:1970</bib>.

Here you see casts of some of the teeth of <em>Gigantopithecus blacki</em>. Assuming that <i>Gigantopithecus</i> had the same proportion of tooth size and body mass as living apes, these Chinese remains would suggest a body mass of over 400 kg for the largest individuals. But should we assume a model of body size like that of today's large great apes, such as the orangutan and gorilla? Or should we assume a model in which <em>Gigantopithecus</em> had enlarged jaws and teeth relative to its mass, as is the case in the extinct robust australopithecines?

Examine the <em>Gigantopithecus</em> teeth in comparison to modern gorilla teeth and jaws, and the teeth and jaws of <em>Australopithecus boisei</em> and <em>Australopithecus robustus</em>. How do the femora of <em>A. robustus</em> compare to the gorilla femur? How do the molars of these species compare? Which do you think is the better model for <em>Gigantopithecus</em>, and what would you predict as the body mass of this extinct species?
