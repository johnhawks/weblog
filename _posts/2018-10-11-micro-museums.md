On the subject of <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/museums/museum-collections-parasitic-plant-species-2018.html">natural history museums changing</a> for the future, this update from the Simons Foundation is fascinating: <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/report2017/stories/science-sandbox-the-changing-face-of-science-museums/">"Science Sandbox: The changing face of science museums"</a>.

<blockquote>MICRO, a nonprofit founded in 2016 by computational ecologist Amanda Schochet and media producer Charles Philipp, works with designers, artists and scientists to pack knowledge into cabinets of curiosity about the size of a vending machine. MICRO increases exposure to science learning by partnering with venues such as the Brooklyn Public Library, Ronald McDonald House and Rockefeller Center to install these tiny museums. The first museum in their ‘fleet,’ the Smallest Mollusk Museum, can go almost anywhere, from hospital waiting rooms to community centers and malls, reaching people where they already are.</blockquote>

This is such a cool idea. It's like a tiny bookmobile for mollusc science.

I'm going to start planning a tiny cabinet that might work in public outreach for human origins. I think this has a lot of promise.
