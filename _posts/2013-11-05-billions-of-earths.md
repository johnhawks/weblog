The Bad Astronomer explains this week's new Kepler-assisted astronomy findings: <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/11/04/earth_like_exoplanets_planets_like_ours_may_be_very_common.html">"The Sky May Be Filled with Earth-like Planets"</a>. 

<blockquote>When they were done, they found that 22 percent of Sun-like stars have Earth-like planets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thats pretty amazing. The galaxy must be full of planets like ours! In fact, if you look at how many stars like this are nearby, you find that, statistically speaking, the nearest such Earth-like planet may be only 12 light years away! Again, thats just what the odds are. Still, there are well over 100 Sun-like stars within 50 light years, so the chance of a few of them having Earth-like planets seems pretty high.</blockquote>

Going to some of these planets is one of the big problems in the future of anthropology.
