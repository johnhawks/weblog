<i>National Geographic</i> is <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071214-giant-skeleton.html">reporting on an internet hoax</a>: <br />
 
<blockquote>A digitally altered photograph created in 2002 shows a reclining giant surrounded by a wooden platform -- with a shovel-wielding archaeologist thrown in for scale.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>By 2004 the "discovery" was being blogged and emailed all over the world -- "Giant Skeleton Unearthed!"-- and it's been enjoying a revival in 2007.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The photo fakery might be obvious to most people. But the tall tale refuses to lie down even five years later, if a continuing flow of emails to National Geographic News are any indication. (The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News.)</blockquote>

<p>
When they say "giant", they <i>mean</i> GIANT -- the "archaeologist" could use this skull's eye orbit as a chair! I'm not going to reproduce it, but you can <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/21432885.html">click the link</a> to see it.
