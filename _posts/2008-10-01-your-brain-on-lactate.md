<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26973246/">Interesting...</a>

<blockquote>The body breaks carbohydrates from food into glucose, the primary fuel of muscles and the mind. When muscles work hard, they produce lactate as a byproduct. Though recent studies have shown that muscles can re-use the lactate as fuel, conventional wisdom holds that it can also build up in the form of lactic acid, reducing performance and causing pain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The new research shows that the brain can switch to lactate during strenuous exercise, using the muscles' byproduct as backup fuel.</blockquote>

Note: this has nothing to do with lactose metabolism. There's actually a substantial literature on the role of lactate in brain metabolism -- it seems to be very important for times when the brain must recover from hypoxic conditions, so there has been a lot of research. So there probably is a deeper story to be written here -- the "backup energy source" hypothesis is a little simplistic.
