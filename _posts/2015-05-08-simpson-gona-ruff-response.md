I was reading Scott Simpson and colleagues' article from March 2014, "The female <em>Homo</em> pelvis from Gona: Response to Ruff (2010)", in which they go through reasons why the BSN49/P27 fossil pelvis belongs to <em>Homo</em> and not, as Ruff has suggested, some version of <em>Australopithecus</em> or <em>Paranthropus</em>. 

I blogged about the anatomy of the Gona pelvis (BSN 49/P27) when it was first published in 2008: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/lower/gona/gona-pelvis-simpson-2008.html">"Mrs. Elvis, the <em>Homo erectus</em> pelvis"</a>, and raised all the issues that have since become features of the scientific literature. It is a very interesting problem, because BSN49/P27 is <em>only</em> a pelvis; no other skeletal remains have been found from the same individual. Diagnosing pelvic anatomy as belonging to <em>Homo</em> is an interesting problem right now, because of the lack of evidence about pelvic anatomy in late australopiths such as <em>Australopithecus boisei</em> and the presence of <em>Homo</em>-like features in the pelvis of <em>Australopithecus sediba</em>. 

I wanted to flag an interesting observation to which I haven't given much thought before: <em>Au. boisei</em> has not been found at any of the Afar sites. This comes in Simpson and colleagues' argument that the Gona pelvis BSN49/P27 must be <em>Homo</em> because only <em>Homo</em> has been found in the area during the same time interval. 

<blockquote>Finally, Ruff proposed that the Gona pelvis could possibly have been a representative of a species outside of the genus <em>Homo</em>, such as <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em>. Unfortunately, no fossils were allocated to this species in his analysis. No pelvis of <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em> is known and no <em>Australopithecus</em> have been discovered from the Afar region that are younger than 2.5 Ma. Fossils representing the ‘robust’ group were all from Swartkrans and assignable to <em>Au. (P.) robustus</em>. While assigning the Gona pelvis to <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em> might seem like a possibility, the absence of any known comparative material makes this assignment untestable as it is not based on comparative data.</blockquote>

Later in the paper, they reiterate this point: 

<blockquote>Despite significant effort surveying for fossils, no specimens attributable to <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em> are known from the Afar region. The Konso, Ethiopia ( Suwa et al., 1997) specimens are the northernmost representatives currently known. Currently, <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em> is not known from any deposits younger than 1.4 Ma ( Suwa et al., 1997). Thus, the 0.9–1.4 Ma Gona pelvis, if it was assignable to <em>Au. (P.) boisei</em>, would be the unique representative from the Afar region and the last appearance datum for this species.</blockquote>

This is perhaps less surprising than it sounds at first, because there are no other <em>Homo</em> specimens reported from Afar during the time span between the date reported for the A.L. 666-1 specimen (2.33 million years)  (Kimbel et al. 1997) and the much later Daka specimens (Asfaw et al. 2002) around a million years old. Based on the stratigraphic information published by Simpson et al. (2008), the Gona pelvis lies either within this gap or at the tail end of it. 

Amid such a near-total lack of fossil evidence, I wouldn't readily dismiss the idea that some late australopith may have been present in the Afar area during the Early Pleistocene. 

But what would it mean if <em>Au. boisei</em> and other late australopiths really never lived in the Afar area? An absence from Afar would contrast strongly with the Turkana Basin, where <em>Au. boisei</em> is the most common fossil hominin within the sediments leading up to 1.4 million years ago. The Turkana Basin includes a good fraction of southern Ethiopia, where what may be the earliest occurrence of <em>Au. boisei</em> is in the Shungura Formation. The latest occurrence of <em>Au. boisei</em> is also in southern Ethiopia, near Konso. Some recent species do have biogeographic distributions that suggest a split between northeastern and southern Ethiopia; whether such a split was present or relevant for <em>Au. boisei</em> may be worth investigation. 

It is a bit odd that no robust australpiths are yet known from North Africa or West Asia. <em>Theropithecus</em>---the genus including living geladas---existed as far as Morocco and India during the Pleistocene. The usual reconstruction of australopiths would suggest they should have been able to disperse effectively through savanna and along rivers and coastlines. Maybe <em>Au. boisei</em> will yet be found outside of its known Rift Valley range.
