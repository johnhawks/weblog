I missed this at the time, but when <i>National Geographic</i> had that Neandertal issue a couple of years ago, they <a href="http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2008/10/project-runway-the-neanderthal-challenge.html">commissioned some Project Runway designers to make outfits for their female Neandertal reconstruction</a>, named "Wilma." The outfits are, unfortunately, pretty conventional cavewoman attire. The <i>NG</i> staffers on the list did a better job coming up with culturally interesting Neandertal apparel.
