An <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert/?printable=true">interesting profile</a> of Buckminster Fuller in the current <i>New Yorker</i>, by author Elizabeth Kolbert. The occasion is a <a href="http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp">retrospective exhibition</a> at the Whitney Museum of American Art. 

Nice article. Here's a great quote from Fuller: 

<blockquote>If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top . . . that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterdays fortuitous contrivings.</blockquote>

He sounds at times like the 1930's equivalent of a blogger, documenting his life with hundreds of thousands of pages of notes. 

This is my favorite quote: 

<blockquote>Fuller was also deeply pessimistic about people's capacity for change, which was why, he said, he had become an inventor in the first place. "I made up my mind . . . that I would never try to reform man -- that's much too difficult," he told an interviewer for this magazine in 1966. "What I would do was to try to modify the environment in such a way as to get man moving in preferred directions."</blockquote>

Something to think about in the age of genetic manipulation.
