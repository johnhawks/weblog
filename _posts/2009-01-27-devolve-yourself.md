The Open University is publicizing some of its Darwiniana with the help of an applet called <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/darwin/devolve-me.php">"Devolve me"</a>. You upload a picture of yourself, and well: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/heidelberg-hawks.jpg" width="200" height="264" alt="Whoa, bro, Hawks has a fro!" />
</div>

You're morphed into <i>Homo heidelbergensis!</i> Or your choice of three other hominids. 

Well, they could have stopped a step or two sooner, I suppose.
