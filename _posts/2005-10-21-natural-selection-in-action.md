In honor of Halloween, the <i>Washington Post</i> has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9757852/">a story on extreme pumpkin-growers</a>. It's a great example of massive phenotypic change in a few generations: 
</p>

<blockquote>Thousands of new growers, even including some in the warm, pumpkin-unfriendly climes around Washington, have been attracted to the mad-scientist thrill of growing a fruit the size of a boulder. For some reason, at least 80 percent of them have been men.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Over the years, more growers have meant more pumpkins, and more chances to cross one behemoth with another.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As this practice has become more popular, the seeds of certain well-known pumpkins -- such as a 723-pound New York specimen whose illustrious offspring have made it the Alydar of squash -- can bring hundreds of dollars at auction. At training seminars, growers will play "pumpkin poker," for one seed a hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Everyone's dreaming that these unions of big pumpkins will produce a generation that is bigger still.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We've put a man on the moon. We've run the four-minute mile," said Ray Waterman, who runs a seed and supply company outside Buffalo. "And now we're going to grow a 2,000-pound pumpkin."</blockquote>

<p>
The world record size has gone from 400 pounds in the 1980's up to 1469 points this month. But it's not all genetics: 
</p>

<blockquote>While the pumpkin's roots were sunk in the soil, Beauchemin shaded its prized fruit from the elements and placed it on a low-friction fabric. In the weeks to come, he knew, the mega-pumpkin would expand so fast that the roughness of the bare ground might slow it down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It never felt the dirt," he said. "And it never felt the rain."</blockquote>

<p>
With all their fertilizing and watering, these people are making a pumpkin secular trend. For fame, glory, and -- for the not-so-lucky -- the chance to cut the giant squash in half and fit a trolling motor for a spin around the river.
