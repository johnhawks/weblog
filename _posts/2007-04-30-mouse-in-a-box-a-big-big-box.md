At last, someone may have the courage to try to harness the brainpower of the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/when_lab_mice_attack_2005.html">superintelligent fearless mice</a>. 
</p>

<p>
And that someone is...<b>IBM!</b>

<blockquote>US researchers have simulated half a virtual mouse brain on a supercomputer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The scientists ran a "cortical simulator" that was as big and as complex as half of a mouse brain on the BlueGene L supercomputer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other smaller simulations the researchers say they have seen characteristics of thought patterns observed in real mouse brains.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now the team is tuning the simulation to make it run faster and to make it more like a real mouse brain.</blockquote>

I'm thinking two things: First, this is a neuron-level interaction simulation; so it will be interesting to see what kinds of phenomena can be modeled accurately at that level, and what kinds require subcellular or genetic controls that aren't modeled here.

<p>
Second, I'm wondering how the heck the BBC manages to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6600965.stm">write stories</a> where every sentence is its own paragraph!
</p>

<p>
I mean, every single one!

<p>
But seriously, the question of gene-level interactions (with differential expression in different neuron types, and different brain regions) versus purely network-scale interactions will be an interesting emerging question from work like this, particularly since we have the mouse brain <a href="http://www.brainatlas.org">gene expression atlas</a>.
