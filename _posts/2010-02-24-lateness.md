Jeffrey Zeldman: advice for business that works just as well in academics: <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/02/05/free-advice-show-up-early/">"Show up early"</a>

<blockquote>How can a client blame you for a cab drivers mistake? How can a conference organizer hold you accountable for an airlines cancelled flight?

They can do it because lateness is part of the order of things, and grownup professionals plan for it, just as they plan for budget shortfalls and extra rounds of revision.</blockquote>
