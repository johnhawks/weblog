There's a really interesting animation of the spreading Iceland ash plume, made into a YouTube by Jonathan Crowe: <a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/maproom/2010/04/eyjafjallajoeku_1.php">"Eyjafjallajkull and European Airspace"</a>. 

Many anthropologists visiting from Europe are still in Albuquerque, trying to get home. Others are being hosted by their friends here in the U.S. until they can get flights back home. My best wishes to all of them.
