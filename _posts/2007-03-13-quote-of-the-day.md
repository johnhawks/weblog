<blockquote>When I say 'our science' I mean what is called the science of Early Man or Palaeoanthropology, of which one quarter is anthropology, another palaeontology, another archaeology, and the last quarter is composed of fantasy, intuition, hard work and good luck, because our early ancestors really are elusive. What in more than a hundred years has been discovered of Neanderthal Man, fills but a small churchyard. What is known of pre-Neanderthal Man can be placed on two middle-sized tables, and what might belong to our Tertiary ancestors I can put on the palm of my hand. You can expect traces of Early Man practically everywhere, in caves, sand pits, and Chinese drugstores, but the hunt is still difficult, you have to be hunter and dog in one person.</blockquote>
