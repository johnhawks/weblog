The Beagle Project Blog <a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/2008/01/tuesday-top-ten-bloggers-for-beagle.html">lists me</a> as one of the top ten senders of traffic to their site, which reports on the efforts to replicate the original voyage:
</p>

<blockquote>We aim to celebrate Charles Darwin's 200th birthday by building a sailing replica of HMS Beagle and recreating the <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i> with an international crew of researchers, aspiring scientists and science communicators. The voyage will apply the techniques of 21st century science to Darwin's journey, inspiring a new generation of scientists and promoting the public understanding of evolution and wider science.</blockquote>
