From an <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19443010/">article</a> announcing a Sasquatch hunt in Michigan's Upper Peninsula: 
</p>

<blockquote>Dr. Grover Krantz, a scientist specializing in cryptozoology, believes Bigfoot is a "gigantopithecus," a branch of primitive man believed to have existed 3 million years ago.</blockquote>
