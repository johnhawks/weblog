<em>Vegas Seven</em> has a great interview with biological anthropologist Debra Martin: <a href="http://vegasseven.com/2016/07/13/seven-questions-biological-anthropologist-debra-martin/">"Seven Questions With Biological Anthropologist Debra Martin"</a>, touching on her work in bioarchaeology and how it relates to the public perception of forensics. This snippet of ongoing work caught my attention: 

<blockquote>We’re interested in non-lethal violence [in the ancient Southwest]. We’ve been collecting data from skeletal [remains] from all over the ancient Southwest, trying to get a feel for differences across adult ages, differences between [genders] to see if there’s a pattern of non-lethal violence. When people migrated to other places, that’s where we start to see some of these head wounds show up. It’s really hard for migrants to enter into new locations. Migrants are highly stressed populations and are the subjects of more violence today, as we’re seeing in Syria.</blockquote>
