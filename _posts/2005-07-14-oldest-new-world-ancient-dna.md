<i>Nature</i> is running <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7048/full/436162b.html">a short piece</a> (subscription required)  on work by Brian Kemp (UC Davis) sequencing DNA from a 10,000-year-old mandible from Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. <br />
 
<blockquote>The DNA was extracted from teeth, more than 10,000 years old, found in a cave on the northern tip of Prince of Wales Island, off southern Alaska. Researchers compared the pattern of mutations in the DNA against those in thousands of samples. They found matches with 47 Native Americans from tribes living in areas ranging from North America to Tierra del Fuego, showing how the caveman's descendants must have spread.</blockquote>

Not much else; the research was presented at a meeting and is not yet in a journal.
