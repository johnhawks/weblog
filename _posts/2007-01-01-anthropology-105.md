<p>Welcome to the course page for Anthropology 105, spring 2007. I'm looking forward to a great semester. </p>

<p>
Are you looking for the lecture outlines? You can find them on the Learn@UW site for the class. I can't link directly in, since a login is required for enrolled students, but I can give you <a href="https://learnuw.wisc.edu">a link to the main login page</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Also at that site, you will be able to find an online copy of the syllabus with important dates, some online quizzes, and other course materials -- including the discussion papers for Honors students. 
</p>

<p>
If you have questions about the class at any time, be sure to ask your TA or myself and we will do everything we can to assist you!
</p>
