I wrote a short post about the arsenate-bacteria story last weekend; in the meantime the story has developed. Carl Zimmer ran a long story early this week, reflecting many scientists' criticisms of the work and the response of the authors:

<blockquote>"Any discourse will have to be peer-reviewed in the same manner as our paper was, and go through a vetting process so that all discussion is properly moderated," wrote Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. "The items you are presenting do not represent the proper way to engage in a scientific discourse and we will not respond in this manner."</blockquote>

Zimmer <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/12/08/of-arsenic-and-aliens-what-the-critics-said/">documents the on-the-record comments by experts</a> on his blog. This is a nice piece of reporting, it's impressive the number of people from whom he has thoughtful comments. 

I like <a href="http://blog.coturnix.org/2010/12/09/quick-links-106/">Bora Zivkovic's analogy: </a>

<blockquote>I love all the parallels between #wikileaks and #arseniclife, especially in how the power-structure position influences views of critics and supporters When comparing #wikileaks and #arseniclife it is important to compare the attitudes of the MSM  does it align with the rock (state, government, institutions, traditional hierarchy and power-structure, top-down control) or the hard-place (people formerly known as audience, including people with greater expertise on the topic than journalists, bottom-up control, democratization of information, freedom of information)?</blockquote>
