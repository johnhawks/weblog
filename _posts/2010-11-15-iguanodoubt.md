Darren Naish has written <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-explosion-of-iguanodon-part-i-2010-11-15">a nice discussion of the taxonomic difficulties of <i>Iguanodon</i></a>. It's a guest post at the <i>Scientific American</i> blog. Dinosaurs and hominins seem to be the most prominent cases where old taxonomic names end up causing problems, so it's nice to have clearly-written summaries that illustrate both the scientific issues and the involvement of the <i>nomenklatura</i> in resolving disputes.
