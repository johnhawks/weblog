Archaeologist (and blogger) Michael E. Smith writes some thoughts about <a href="http://www.anthropologiesproject.org/2011/05/why-anthropology-is-too-narrow.html">"Why anthropology is too narrow an intellectual context for archaeology." 

<blockquote>Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips (1958) once claimed that archaeology is anthropology or it is nothing, and Lewis Binford (1962) promoted a program of archaeology as anthropology [see also Gillespie, 2003 #9111]. I disagree with these views. Had my research on comparative urbanism remained within the confines of anthropology, it would have remained pedestrian and limited in scope. Based on my personal experience, I suggest that the intellectual horizons of archaeology should not be limited to the rather parochial discipline of anthropology.</blockquote>

There are many jingoistic scholars who claim to love anthropology because it encompasses everything. I, for one, think that the field that tries to encompass everything will thereby mean nothing. 

I resist making a tag for "disciplinarity". 

One more thing: The <a href="http://www.anthropologiesproject.org/">Anthropologies</a> project, which I've linked a couple of times now, is a really good idea.
