<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GeneticFuture/~3/324627241/sanger-institute-sequences-its.html">Genetic Future comments</a> on news from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute:

<blockquote>At the current rate (which is rapidly increasing) the Sanger is churning out more DNA sequence every two minutes than was generated by the entire research community from 1982-1987. This obscene rate of data generation has been enabled by the development of next-generation DNA sequencing platforms, which can each churn out one human genome equivalent in less than a week.</blockquote>
