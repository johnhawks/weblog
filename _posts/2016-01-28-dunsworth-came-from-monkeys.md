I endorse <a href="http://www.sapiens.org/blog/origins/monkeys-all-the-way-down/">this message from Holly Dunsworth</a>: 


<blockquote>Everyone’s likely heard it or seen it written on a protest sign: “I didn’t evolve from a monkey.” It’s a well-worn refrain of those who resist the evolutionary perspective. The pat response we often hear is, “You’re right! We didn’t evolve from monkeys. We share ancestors with them.” However, this talking point isn’t entirely honest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, we share ancestors with monkeys; we share ancestors with every living thing. But, also, to be clear: We <em>did</em> evolve from monkeys.</blockquote>

That's from her new blog, <a href="http://www.sapiens.org/blogs/origins/">"Origins"</a>, from the new website, <a href="http://sapiens.org">SAPIENS</a>. It's a new public communication portal sponsored by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, and I'll look forward to seeing more of what they have in store.
