Here's a happy <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16318451/">AP article</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>BRISTOL, England - A western lowland gorilla has given birth at a zoo in southwest England after being given a fertility drug that is normally used on humans, zoo officials said Friday.</blockquote>

<p>
She's been trying for 20 years, after having a first baby young. 
</p>

<blockquote>After consulting gynecologist David Hill, a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol, zoo veterinarians gave Salome a fertility drug called clomifene to stimulate ovulation, Carroll said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Salome became pregnant three months after first receiving the treatments, he said.</blockquote>

<p>
We're running completely irony- and snark-free here on Christmas. Nothing more than a touching story of gorilla motherhood. 
</p>

<blockquote>"Female gorillas, like their human counterparts, find conceiving more difficult as they get older, so zoos may now be able to give some of their important breeders a helping hand," Caroll said. "Being able to treat female gorillas with human fertility drugs is potentially a very important breakthrough."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Carroll said the treatment was likely to be replicated worldwide.</blockquote>

OK, I guess that was a little bit too <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale"><i>Handmaid's Tale</i>-like</a>...
