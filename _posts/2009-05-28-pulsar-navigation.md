The physics arXiv blog from MIT Technology Review <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/23576/">points to a paper</a> that describes a way to use pulsars as an interstellar GPS system. 

<blockquote>With the co-ordinate system established, any interplanetary spacecraft could then use the signals from these pulsars to determine its position in this co-ordinate system to within a few nanoseconds, which corresponds to about a metre.</blockquote>

Yes, I know, after <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1999">the ant compass post</a>, some of you are beginning to wonder about my sanity. Isn't it interesting that "GPS system" has become the media synonym for basic navigation? I figure it's all because of iPhone marketing.
