<em>Triplecanopy</em> has a fascinating visual-text piece by Isabelle Moffat about the depiction of the brain from the Middle Ages to today: <a href="http://canopycanopycanopy.com/18/this_is_your_brain_on_paper">"This is your brain on paper"</a>. 

<blockquote>More than anything, looking at historical representations of the brain reveals their absolute contingency: Every period has its own tools and instrumentsintellectual and physicaland their limitations never seem to be fully grasped. Only when the next tool comes along, or the paradigm shifts, do changes in the questions we ask also make possible other answers.</blockquote>

I nearly missed the click-through series of medieval pictures in the middle of the story, with some incredible figures.
