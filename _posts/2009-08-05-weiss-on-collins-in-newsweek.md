Why is Ken Weiss <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/209440">invading my <i>Newsweek</i></a>? 

<blockquote>On a blog, anthropologist Kenneth M. Weiss complained recently that as Human Genome Project director, Collins "directly or indirectly intimidated other NIH agencies to get into the genome game  That did, and still does, co-opt funds that could be used for other things instead." </blockquote>

GASP! Why is Ken Weiss invading <b>blogs</b>!?! 

Here's a link: <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2009/07/francis-collins-and-nih.html">"Francis Collins and the NIH"</a>. <i>Newsweek</i> should know it's the height of dishonesty to cite from a blog without providing proper sourcing, so that readers can check for themselves that it has been cited accurately. 

The blog, <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/">"The Mermaid's Tale"</a>, is written by Weiss and Anne Buchanan. I've added it to my feed!
