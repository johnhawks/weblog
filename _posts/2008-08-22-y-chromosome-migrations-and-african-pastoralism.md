Sharon Begley <a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/labnotes/archive/2008/08/08/human-evolution-tale-of-the-y.aspx">covers a recent paper by Joanna Mountain</a> on Y chromosome migrations and African pastoralists: 

<blockquote>The novel mutation arose in eastern Africa about 10,000 years ago and was carried by migration to southern Africa about 2,000 years ago not by Bantu-speakers, in whom the mutation is absent, but in speakers of whats called the Nilotic language. These unsuspected ancestors first brought herds of animals to southern Africa before the Bantu migration.</blockquote>

To me, this is one of the most useful applications of genetics to prehistory: finding migrations that have been largely obscured by later movements. But it's tricky, and faces a major problem in the fact that recent selection has also generated demographic forces. Of course, if the migrations were somehow <i>connected</i> to the selection, that would be less of a problem...
