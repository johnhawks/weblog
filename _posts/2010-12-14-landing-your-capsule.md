Vintage Space is <a href="http://vintagespace.wordpress.com/about/">a blog written by a historian of spaceflight</a>, which has lately been focusing on the development of landing systems in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. The posts are just fascinating, including <a href="http://vintagespace.wordpress.com/2010/11/24/splashdowns-why-change-a-good-thing/">"Splashdowns: Why change a good thing?", <a href="http://vintagespace.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/landings-nasa-and-the-soviet-space-program/">"Landings, NASA, and the Soviet space program"</a>, and most recently, <a href="http://vintagespace.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/inventing-landings/">"Inventing landings"</a>. 

It is impressive to read about the sheer number of naval units put at NASA's disposal for the early landings.
