At <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory">Mixing Memory</a>, Chris <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2008/07/fart_spray_and_disgust_more_ge.php">describes a study</a> that is just twisted enough to make you want to be a psychologist: 

<blockquote>n their first experiment, participants read the vignettes while being exposed either to a lot of fart spray ("strong stink" condition), a little fart spray ("mild stink" condition), or no fart spray (control). The fart spray was supposed to induce disgust, which, under Haidt's theory, is associated with immorality. Therefore, the fart spray should increase the severity of moral judgments. Consistent with this hypothesis, for three of the five vignettes in the mild stink condition, and two of the five in the strong stink condition, participants' acceptability ratings (i.e., they rated actions like sex with a first cousin as being more immoral) decreased relative to the control condition.</blockquote>

Like I said, twisted.
