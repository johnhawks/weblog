<I>National Geographic</i>, as you might expect, has some nice pictures of the MH1 skull in a news story: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/04/photogalleries/100408-australopithecus-sediba-human-species-fossil-pictures/#australopithecus-sediba-skull-oblique-view_18458_600x450.jpg">"Pictures: New human ancestor fossils found"</a>. There's one of the site and nice shots of Sts 5 and KNM-ER 1470, too.
