Many of us are preparing for classes to start in the next few weeks. Kate Clancy's post today, <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/2011/08/16/non-science-students-in-a-science-class/">"Non-science students in a science class"</a>, had me nodding in recognition at some parts. She summarizes her problem: 

<blockquote>They just happen to be non-science majors taking an enormous science course as part of their general education requirements. This is what I have come up against, again and again. Many of them are terrified and think they will fail, and they are emailing me mundane questions I know they can answer because they just want to make a connection. Many have already been convinced by someone earlier in their lives that they arent good at science. Many went to schools with struggling science programs, or they were taught only enough to pass placement tests. Its not their fault that we dont invest enough as a culture or country in science education to give teachers the tools they need to excite students about science and give them confidence in it.</blockquote>

It would be great to see a good conversation emerge in her comment section.
