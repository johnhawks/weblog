Jay Rosen offers some interesting advice about organizing a panel in the age of Twitter: <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2010/03/17/backchannel.html">"How the Backchannel Has Changed the Game for Conference Panelists"</a>. 

I'm thinking about organizing a session for the AAPA meetings next year, in a way that would be significantly more interactive than the usual series of stand-and-talks. I'll be interested to see this year how many people are posting their reactions to talks using the "backchannel."
