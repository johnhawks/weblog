<em>Nature's</em> "SpotOn" feature has interviewed University of Rhode Island biological anthropologist Holly Dunsworth about her social media mastery: <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/2013/04/social-media-for-science-outreach-a-case-study-blogging-about-evolution/">"Social Media for Science Outreach  A Case Study: Blogging about Evolution"</a>.

<blockquote>I also saw the blog as an opportunity to not only to find my voice, but to be comfortable doing so in public. Having been confined to a few academic papers and one reference book, I was excited to be writing about my field, and beyond, with immediate publication and full editorial control. I also hoped that blogging would open up other new opportunities. Recently I wrote a post covering many of the outcomes, direct or indirect, from my participation in social media, especially on The Mermaids Tale, <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2013/03/you-gonna-blog-that.html">here.</a></blockquote>

I don't remember if I've linked Holly's post, <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2013/03/you-gonna-blog-that.html">"You gonna blog that?"</a> but it is well worthwhile as a discussion of the use of blogging in the development of a career in biological anthropology.
