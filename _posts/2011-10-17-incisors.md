The incisors are the front teeth. They are basically flat and have a blade-like occlusal surface. Each quadrant has two incisors.

In humans and other primates, the upper central incisor (called the I<sup>1</sup>) is typically larger, the lateral (the I<sup>2</sup>) smaller. 


At this station you'll find casts of several primates, including some prosimians with tooth combs. Examine these mandibles. Some of the tooth combs include four teeth, and some six. The tooth combs with six teeth include the two incisors (I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>) and the lower canines. The four-tooth combs are missing either the lateral incisor or the canine. Specialists disagree on this point. What do you think?
