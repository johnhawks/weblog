Is there any better example of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/23/woman-scares-charging-bear-courgette">the importance of throwing for our evolution</a>? 

<blockquote><b>Woman scares off charging bear  with a courgette</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The woman jumped back and grasped the nearest object on her kitchen counter inside the doorway  a 30cm long courgette. She threw the courgette at the bear from a distance she estimated to be about a metre, The vegetable hit the bear on the top of its head and the animal fled, Maricelli said.</blockquote>

The woman fought off a <i>bear</i> by throwing a <i>zucchini</i>.

It started by attacking her dog -- the bear, not the zucchini. I don't necessarily credit the attack as evidence against the value of dog domestication, although it does increase the likelihood that they are not principally formidable hunting weapons and are instead intended as <i>bait</i>.
