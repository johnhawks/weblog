Last year <em>Atlas Obscura</em> published a review of the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2EkXLmh"><em>Black Tudors</em></a>, by Miranda Kaufmann: <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/black-african-tudors-england">"The Africans Who Called Tudor England Home"</a>.

<blockquote>As <em>Black Tudors</em> details, Africans weren’t just members of society but were present during some of the major events of the Tudor era. Jacques Francis, a salvage diver from Guinea in West Africa, worked the wreck of the Mary Rose and Diego the circumnavigator explored the globe with Francis Drake. The aforementioned John Blanke would have certainly enjoyed some celebrity during his time due to his position in the royal court. He even performed at Henry VIII’s coronation and married a London woman. So, what changed? What prompted England to become a key nation in promulgating the Atlantic slave trade?</blockquote>

Sounds like an interesting history.
