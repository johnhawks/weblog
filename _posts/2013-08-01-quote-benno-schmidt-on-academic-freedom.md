From today's <em>Wall Street Journal</em>: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324809004578637713582677352.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop">"Benno Schmidt: Mitch Daniels's Gift to Academic Freedom"</a>

<blockquote>If academics want to continue to enjoy the great privilege of academic freedom, they cannot forget the obligations that underline the grant of that privilege. The American Association of University Professors itself recognized those obligations in its seminal statement, the 1915 Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom, which is today nearly forgotten: "If this profession should prove itself unwilling to purge its ranks of the incompetent and unworthy, or to prevent the freedom which it claims . . . from being used as a shelter for inefficiency, for superficiality, or for uncritical and intemperate partisanship, it is certain that the task will be performed by others."</blockquote>
