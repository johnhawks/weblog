My undergraduate alma mater is <a href="http://www.ksu.edu">Kansas State University</a>. Last night, <a href="http://www.ktka.com/news/2008/jun/12/tornado_kstate_campus/">a tornado tore through the campus</a>, damaging many buildings where my friends and I had classes, but thankfully not injuring anyone: 

<blockquote>Cardwell Hall, Burt Hall and the engineering complex were all damaged. Ward Hall, the home to K-State's nuclear reactor, was damaged. Staff has already covered the roof to protect the reactor, which officials say remains safe and unharmed. University cars were overturned and trees uprooted too.</blockquote>

Yes, in Kansas last night, <b>a tornado hit a nuclear reactor</b>. And there was no incident, no apparent danger, everything handled properly. I think that's a good reminder that things <i>can</i> be engineered safely. Good work, K-State!
