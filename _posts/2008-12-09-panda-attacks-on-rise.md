Panda <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28127056/">attacks</a> on rise:

<blockquote>HONG KONG - A giant panda named Peace bit a park keeper's left leg while he was laying bamboo leaves in the animal's pen at a Hong Kong amusement park, officials said Tuesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although pandas look cute and cuddly, they are wild animals that can be violent when provoked or startled.</blockquote>

Since <i>domesticated</i> animals can be violent when provoked or startled, this is hardly probative. Now, if they get to the level of chimp attacks, we should be concerned.
