Donald McNeil, Jr., reports in the <em>New York Times</em> on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/health/zika-virus-puerto-rico.html?ref=health&_r=0">the impending spread of Zika virus into Puerto Rico</a>: 

<blockquote>A quarter of the island’s 3.5 million people will probably get the Zika virus within a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and eventually 80 percent or more may be infected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’m very concerned,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, said in an interview after a recent three-day visit to Puerto Rico. “There could be thousands of infections of pregnant women this year.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>The epidemic is unfolding in one of the country’s most popular vacation destinations, where planes and cruise ships disembark thousands of tourists daily. Anyone could carry the virus back home, seeding a mosquito-borne outbreak or transmitting it sexually.</blockquote>

Nothing looks like it is capable of stopping this virus from becoming endemic wherever the right mosquito habitat exists.
