Tokamak fusion reactors <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427291.300-building-a-second-sun-take-10-billion-add-coconuts.html?full=true">need charcoal to adsorb certain particles</a>. It was a very lucky day for some coconut growers:

<blockquote>The best fusion coconut turned out to come from one particular Indonesian island, Day found, and the quality of the resulting charcoal even depends on the year. "2002 was an excellent year for coconuts," he says.

So the team bought up most of the vintage 2002 Indonesian coconut-shell charcoal.</blockquote>

The <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427291.300-building-a-second-sun-take-10-billion-add-coconuts.html?full=true">linked article</a> (from <i>New Scientist</i>) describes some of the technical challenges of fusion research.
