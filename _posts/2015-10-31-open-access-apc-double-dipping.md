From Leti Kleyn, in the South African edition of <em>The Conversation</em>, a call for better institutional open access archives: <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-its-getting-harder-to-access-free-quality-academic-research-49603">"Why it’s getting harder to access free, quality academic research"</a>.

<blockquote>But these changes in support of broader public access seem to have been to little avail. Publishers are maximising profits with a hybrid model of double payments, also referred to as “double dipping”. They collect Article Processing Charges from researchers to publish in an Open Access format and still collect subscription fees from users.</blockquote>

<blockquote>British higher education support body JISC conducted a study to explore this practice. It averaged the APC payment for 2014 by 20 universities in the United Kingdom at £1581. It concluded in a separate study that the overall increase in the total cost of ownership – subscription and APCs – when compared to capped subscription fees was as high at 73% at one UK institution.</blockquote>
