Biologists <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2008/09/squirrel-smasher.html">to get their own accelerator</a>:

<blockquote>Dallas, TX  Scientists from the Evolutionary Acceleration Research Institute (EARI) announced that the first test of the Giant Animal Smasher (GAS) will begin on December 19, 2008, the 41st anniversary of the premiere of Dr. Dolittle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Biologists from around the globe hope the GAS will unlock the secrets of the so-called "Darwin particle" that could unlock the secrets to life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If we discover the Darwin particle we could possibly create new life-forms, or accelerate evolution to unimaginable levels," said Malwin.</blockquote>
