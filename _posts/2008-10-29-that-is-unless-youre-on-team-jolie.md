In the Halloween spirit yet? If not, think about <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1081303/Scientists-discover-single-brain-cell-dedicated-Jennifer-Aniston-inside-womans-head.html">this</a>:

<blockquote>It is a discovery that could explain the enduring appeal of <i>Friends</i>. Scientists have found brain cells devoted to Jennifer Aniston.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fans of the actress, who played socialite Rachel Green in the Channel 4 sit-com, are likely to have at least one brain cell that springs into action each time they see a picture of her, research suggests.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Other brain cells are similarly encoded to store memories of individual celebrities, from actress Halle Berry to former US presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.</blockquote>

You see, if we could just get every one of the 500 million or so Jennifer-Aniston-aware people to donate that brain cell to science, we could at last create a zombie Frankenmonkeybrain. Then we could surgically implant it within a reverse-aging monkey body, and set it loose to hunt down Lara Croft.
