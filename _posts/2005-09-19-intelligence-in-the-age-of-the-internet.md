CNET is running a series of articles on the kind of intelligence required for the world of changing technology. The <a href="http://news.com.com/Intelligence+in+the+Internet+age/2100-11395_3-5869719.html?part=rss&tag=5869719&subj=news">first installment</a> starts thusly: 
</p>

<blockquote>Today, terabytes of easily accessed data, always-on Internet connectivity, and lightning-fast search engines are profoundly changing the way people gather information. But the age-old question remains: Is technology making us smarter? Or are we lazily reliant on computers, and, well, dumber than we used to be?</blockquote>

<p>
The article's answer is that different skills don't mean different reasoning and learning. Not unexpected, since business' focus in the wake of technological change is always training and retraining the same minds for different skillsets. 
</p>

<p>
The main idea is how memory is less necessary when you have devices to keep track of things for you. I suppose if Sherlock Holmes' theory of mind is right, that means we should be able to fill up our minds with deeper thoughts: 
</p>

<blockquote>"It's true we don't remember anything anymore, but we don't need to," said [Jeff] Hawkins, the co-founder of Palm Computing and author of a book called "On Intelligence."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We might one day sit around and reminisce about having to remember phone numbers, but it's not a bad thing. It frees us up to think about other things. The brain has a limited capacity, if you give it high-level tools, it will work on high-level problems," he said.</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, this presupposes that the brain isn't full of cognitive adaptations that now lie fallow and useless in today's high-tech world. Or get filled with videogames and movies. I guess these fall under the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/1573223077&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=johnhawksanth-20&amp;creative=9325"><i>Everything Bad Is Good for You</i></a> theory. 
</p>

<p>
I wonder what you would call a specialized cognitive adaptation that could be readily reprogrammed in different cultures for different purposes?
