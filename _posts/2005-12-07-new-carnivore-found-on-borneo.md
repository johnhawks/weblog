<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/meet-the-beast-of-borneo/2005/12/06/1133829585117.html">This news story in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i></a> describes it, and has a secret-nighttime-flash picture.

<blockquote>"We have consulted several Bornean wildlife experts. Some thought it looked like a lemur, but most were convinced it was a new species of carnivore," [WWF biologist Stephen] Wulffraat told a news conference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We're 90 per cent sure that this was a new species of carnivore," he said, adding that a live specimen is needed to be 100 per cent certain.</blockquote>

<p>
Well, a live animal would sure make up your mind! On these standards, I suppose finding a new fossil shouldn't make paleoanthropologists more than 20 percent certain of finding new species!
