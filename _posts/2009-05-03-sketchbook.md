Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">

</div>

OK, so I was outside working in the yard, and then I started smoking some meat. You know, pretty much the classic Sunday afternoon in May. So I'm building the fire, and got charcoal all over the work gloves. And I sat down with my sketchbook, and thought, well, I'll draw one of the gloves -- that's a good subject. 

I was pretty far into it, too, when I realized, <b>what better way to draw a charcoal-smudged glove, than with charcoal?</b> So this is what you get when you pick up a chunk of charcoal from the grill and start drawing. 

That's hardwood charcoal, not that junky sawdust-and-clay stuff that Henry Ford invented. I don't imagine briquettes would be nearly as good for drawing.
