My seminar this semester will be examining the evolution of language and stone tool manufacture, building from first principles in evolutionary theory. I'm doing something entirely new for me; the students and I will be building a wiki. That forum will put a large proportion of the output of the class online.

I have been reviewing papers for the course for some time now, with many of them appearing here. I'll be stepping up those efforts, while showing how these "first principles" help to illuminate some problematic aspects of human cognitive evolution. The course begins with a presentation of the core ideas of selection on life history traits, evolutionary game theory, and information theory. Over the next month or so, I will be writing up some guides to these areas of theory and posting them.
