This is a fascinating story of the age of massive databases and loss of human privacy: <a href="http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/">"How an internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell"</a>. 

<blockquote>For the last decade, Taylor and her renters have been visited by all kinds of mysterious trouble. They’ve been accused of being identity thieves, spammers, scammers and fraudsters. They’ve gotten visited by FBI agents, federal marshals, IRS collectors, ambulances searching for suicidal veterans, and police officers searching for runaway children. They’ve found people scrounging around in their barn. The renters have been doxxed, their names and addresses posted on the internet by vigilantes. Once, someone left a broken toilet in the driveway as a strange, indefinite threat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All in all, the residents of the Taylor property have been treated like criminals for a decade. And until I called them this week, they had no idea why.</blockquote>
