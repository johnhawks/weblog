Daniel MacArthur reports from the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology meetings are full of little snippets of next-generation sequencing news; good if you're interested but don't follow the developments closely: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/belated_news_from_agbt.php">"Belated news from AGBT"</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/pacific_biosciences_session_at.php">"Pacific Biosciences introduces new third-generation sequencing instrument at AGBT"</a>. 

UPDATE (2010-02-28): And <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/02/new_players_in_sequencing_debu.php">"New players in sequencing debut at AGBT"</a>. 

<blockquote>If that's true, and if it can be done at scale, it is <i>extraordinarily</i> cool: reads of unlimited length would profoundly transform genomics</blockquote>
