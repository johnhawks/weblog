<p>
Duffy, Wrangham and Silk describe in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.001">a short paper</a> the correlation of male mating success and support for the alpha male in a group of chimpanzees. The finding isn't surprising -- it's been long assumed that subordinate male chimpanzees participate in coalitions to attain mating rewards -- but it's a nice quantification. Helping the alpha male maintain his status had a much larger impact on mating success than rank.
