David Dobbs <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/marc-hauser-news-a-settling-or-pre-quake-tremors/">helpfully reviews the past few weeks of Marc Hauser-related revelations</a>: 

<blockquote>Overall, I think this replication is a wash in terms of its impact on Hausers larger issues. Some will see some redemption here, others more sin. I suspect those will cancel out and that Hauser will stand or fall on the rest of the record, which appears to remain pretty damning.</blockquote>
