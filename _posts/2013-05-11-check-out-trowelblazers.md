If you're interested in the history of archaeology, you are going to really love <a href="http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/">"Trowelblazers"</a>, a Tumblr site with short biographies of female trailblazers of archaeology. 

Like most good Tumblr accounts, this one has some great pictures. The <a href="http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/post/50088852376/maeve-leakey-photo-bob-cambell-turkana-basin">post on Maeve Leakey</a> has a classic photo from the Turkana Basin Institute, and the <a href="http://trowelblazers.tumblr.com/post/50088858366/gertrude-bell-1868-1926-awesome-in-arabia">Gertrude Bell post</a> is full of information and links.
