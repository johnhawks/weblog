<blockquote>Fountain of Bees
An additional Bernini fountain can be found near the Piazza Barberini, right at the foot of the uphill Via Vittorio Veneto. Entitled Fontana delle Api (Fountain of the Bees), this small fountain was built in 1644 as a tribute to Pope Urban VIII Barberini. The fountain features large bees, symbol of the Barberini family, and a clam-like structure, on which appears the name of Urban VIII and a Latin message stating the fountain's water is for use of the public and their animals. http://www.aviewoncities.com/rome/piazzabarberini.htm

Love your travelogue - always nice to see a place one knows through the eyes of someone else.</blockquote>
