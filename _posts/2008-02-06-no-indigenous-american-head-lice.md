Not a lot of detail in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23029782/">this story</a>, but it's an interesting datum: 
</p>

<blockquote>Head lice taken from 1,000-year-old mummies in Peru support the idea that the little creatures accompanied humans on their first migration out of Africa, 100,000 years ago, researchers reported on Wednesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Writing in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, Reed and colleagues noted that there are three known strains, or clades, of head lice -- A, B and C.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clade A is found everywhere, clade B is common in both North America and Europe, and clade C is rare. There had been a theory that clade B evolved separately in the Americas and that European explorers carried A to the Americas and brought B back to Europe with them.</blockquote>

<p>
This is David Reed's work. The Peruvian mummy lice were all members of clade A, meaning that it had been in the Americas before the entry of Europeans.
