Julien Riel-Salvatore <a href="http://averyremoteperiodindeed.blogspot.com/2009/09/two-sides-to-every-biface.html">wrote recently about several handaxe stories</a>, including <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090911134624.htm">the giant ones from paleo-Lake Makgadikgadi</a>. 

<blockquote>By any standard, at 30+cm in length these things are frikkin' huge! Strikingly, the press release only mentions that these very large items were found, without any discussion of how their size is unusual and what this distinctiveness might mean. These specific artifacts are of uncertain age, and their function is also uncertain - at that size, it is unclear exactly what practical function they might have served, as they would have been rather unwieldy to use, unless they were somehow hafted, in which case their heft might be an indication of their ultimate function. </blockquote>
