An <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/usain-bolt-its-just-not-normal/#more-2986">interesting post from Justin Wolfers about statistical outliers and sprinters</a>, referencing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/sports/olympics/21bolt.html">a <i>New York Times</i> story about Usain Bolt</a>, along with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/20/sports/olympics/20080820-bolt-graphic.html">a key graphic</a> showing Bolt's and Michael Johnson's records versus the 249 other fastest 200 meter sprint times in history. Wolfers:

<blockquote>Not only does this not look like a normal distribution, it doesnt even look like the tail of any standard distribution Ive ever seen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It should be clear from this chart why few thought that the previous world record would be broken anytime soon. </blockquote>
