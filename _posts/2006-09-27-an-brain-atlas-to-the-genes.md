The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060926/sc_nm/science_brain_dc_2">news stories</a> are all about how Paul Allen has money to burn, but the brain mapping project is actually really cool: 
</p>

<blockquote>The atlas, begun in 2002 with $100 million from Allen's fortune, was declared finished on Tuesday, with fine-tuned information on 3,000 active genes -- although scientists have been using it regularly for more than a year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The result -- the first project of the Allen Institute for Brain Science -- a 3-D reference atlas of the genes that are active in the mouse brain.</blockquote>

<p>
The website for the <a href="http://www.alleninstitute.org">Allen Institute</a> is fairly dry, but it has a link to the Brain Atlas project and the viewer software, available for Windows and OS X. The viewer qualifies as neat-O in my book and even had my twins oohing and aahing.

<p>
Considering they were looking at sections of mouse brains, that is really something.
