David Biello <a href="http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=C0D3CD91-E7F2-99DF-3D5399013D3691D5">writes a nice profile</a> of demographic researcher Virpi Lummaa: 
</p>

<blockquote>The 33-year-old Finnish biologist, aided by genealogists, has pored through centuries-old tomes (and microfiche) for birth, marriage and death records, which ended up providing glimpses of evolution at work in humanity's recent ancestors. Among them: that male twins disrupt the mating potential of their female siblings by prenatally rendering them more masculine; mothers of sons die sooner than those of daughters, because rearing the former takes a greater toll; and grandmothers are important to the survival of grandchildren. "I'm trying to understand human reproductive behavior from an evolutionary perspective," Lummaa says.</blockquote>

<p>
I wrote about Lummaa's most recent work, on twin fertility, last month (It's the second post <a href="http://www.johnhawks.net/weblog/2007/06/19">here</a>, because for whatever reason, the permalink isn't working right.). That's the post that includes the long update about freemartins -- a twinning effect associated with sterility in cattle and sheep.

Anyway, this is a really good profile of a young scientist -- maybe someday I'll do something interesting enough to merit the same!
