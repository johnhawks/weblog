Joli Jensen in <em>ChronicleVitae</em>: <a href="https://chroniclevitae.com/news/631-it-s-time-to-demolish-the-magnum-opus-myth">"It's time to demolish the magnum opus myth"</a>. 

<blockquote>The magnum-opus myth can spark contempt for our colleagues, too. In order to feel better about our own efforts, we may trash the work of our peers and predecessors, telling ourselves that they aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, and believing it’s our job to show just how flawed their work really is.</blockquote>

If you realize that your job as a scientist is to help your peers and successors to do better work, you'll do better work.
