<i>Ankarapithecus meteai</i> remains include a handful of mandibles and partial faces from Central Turkey, and date to around 10 million years ago (Begun and Gulic, 1998). These remains show many similarities to <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/sivapithecus/"><i>Sivapithecus</i></a> from South Asia, and have sometimes been included in that genus. However, <i>Ankarapithecus</i> lacks a number of features that link <i>Sivapithecus</i> with living and fossil orangutans, causing some paleontologists to suggest that it may represent the earliest radiation of Asian apes. Such a position would explain the retention of many primitive similarities with European apes like <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/dryopithecus/"><i>Dryopithecus</i></a>, and would mean that the Anatolian population survived as a relict of the early Asian radiation even as the subsequent radiation of <i>Sivapithecus</i>  into the later Asian apes occurred in South Asia.
