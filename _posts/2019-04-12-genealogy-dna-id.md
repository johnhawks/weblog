Forensic genealogy is now mainstream. From <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, a report by Kristen Brown: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-12/a-researcher-needed-three-hours-to-identify-me-from-my-dna">"A Researcher Needed Three Hours to Identify Me From My DNA"</a>.

<blockquote>It wasn’t hard. I’d previously sent a DNA sample to the genetic testing company 23andMe Inc. and then uploaded my data anonymously to a genealogy website. Researcher Michelle Trostler was able to access my data from that site and spent an afternoon looking for connections that would help her put a name to my data. The task was so easy that in the meantime she rewatched a season of Game of Thrones.</blockquote>

Seems to me that we are only a few steps in synthetic biology away from people being able to conceive "three-parent" children, where some of the DNA is modeled on the publicly available sequence of someone off the internet.
