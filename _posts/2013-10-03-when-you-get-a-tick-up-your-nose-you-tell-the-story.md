My University of Wisconsin-Madison colleague Tony Goldberg has a new paper doing some innovative ecological genetics: <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/22176">"UW scientist sniffs out possible new tick species"</a>. 

<blockquote>When I got back to the U.S., I realized I had a stowaway, says Goldberg, professor of pathobiological sciences at the UW-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine and associate director for research in the UW-Madison Global Health Institute. When you first realize you have a tick up your nose, it takes a lot of willpower not to claw your face off.</blockquote>

The neat part of this story to me is the way this study benefited from another ongoing study of chimpanzee growth and development: 

<blockquote>Goldbergs stowaway is not the first documented case of a Ugandan nose tick hitching a ride with humans, and others have speculated that these ticks normally infest chimpanzees, which are common in the park. Intrigued, Goldberg enlisted the help of Richard Wrangham, a Harvard University chimp expert, to investigate further. Wrangham and colleagues had just begun using high-resolution digital photography to safely study the timing of molar eruptions in baby chimps from a distance. A closer look at his photos revealed ticks lodged in one-fifth of the chimps noses.</blockquote>

That work, demonstrating for the first time the timing of tooth eruption in a wild chimpanzee population, is an innovative use of technology tied to long-term field research. It seems basic, but it takes a lot of logistics to make reliable observations happen this way. So it's great to see that the photographs can be leveraged for other research purposes.
