<em>The Guardian</em> reports on archaeological recovery work on the South Atlantic island of St. Helena, where construction of a new airport has uncovered a cemetery for African people freed from slave ships and quartered on the island during the nineteenth century (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/08/slave-mass-graves-st-helena-island">"Archaeologists find graves containing bodies of 5,000 slaves on remote island"</a>): 

<blockquote>Pearson, the director of the project, said: "Studies of slavery usually deal with unimaginable numbers, work on an impersonal level and, in so doing, overlook the individual victims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Rupert's Valley, however, the archaeology brings us quite literally face-to-face with the human consequences of the slave trade."</blockquote>

Nice article on one way that archaeology helps to contribute to our understanding of historical events.
