A reader writes to let me know that the <a href="https://tlt.stonybrook.edu/webcast/Pages/default.aspx">talks from the Stony Brook symposium on the Flores hominids</a> are now available for streaming. I haven't had a chance to watch these yet but they may be of interest to many. Previous Leakey symposia are also streamed from the same site.
