Now, I hadn't considered this: 
</p>

<blockquote>How would the world feel, how do you feel, knowing that at the moment you are reading this you may be wearing transgenic underpants?</blockquote>

<p>
Happily, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/16/science/16side.html">has me covered</a>. No, not that way!
</p>

<p>
Yes, it's that kind of story.

<blockquote>Despite some opposition to genetically modified crops, even ones not grown for food, Frankencotton has been so successful that it is now grown all over the world, including the United States. It is particularly popular in Asia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to a recent report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by researchers at the University of Arizona, farmers who grew Bt cotton reduced their use of pesticides and increased the diversity of their insect populations, while protecting crops against the dread pink bollworm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A similar genetic modification in corn has caused an uproar. Many countries have rules about labeling food that contains genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O. Zambia, for instance, has refused to import transgenic corn. But cotton has faced no such trade barriers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The obvious reason is that people tend not to eat their shirts.</blockquote>
