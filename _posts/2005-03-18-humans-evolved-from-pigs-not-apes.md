<p>
On the subject of pigs, there is <a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/features/science/61471">this story</a> from the <i>Weekly World News</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>Charles Darwin was wrong -- humans evolved from pigs, not apes. And that explains the Biblical prohibition against consuming the flesh of our oinking relatives, according to a startling new theory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It's hard to believe, but you and Porky Pig are kissing cousins," says genetic scientist Dr. Basil Hainwright of London.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dim recollections of a time when we trotted on all fours and rolled in the mud with our family members probably survived into Neolithic times."</blockquote>

<p>
This should end once and for all the theory that it's only men....
