Following up on Nicolas Laracuente's Storify collections of tweets from the SAA meetings, I wanted to point to <a href="http://storify.com/archaeologist/blogarch">his compilation from the Blogging Archaeology session</a>. It was a great session, organized by Colleen Morgan, and covering a whole range of activities from outreach, documentation, and academic research using social media and blogs. 

I spoke last night at a session of a class on science communication. It's interesting just how much blogging and other social media have begun to form a seamless set of approaches, capable of bringing people into the world of science. To see this conversation happening at mainstream (and let's face it, kind of crusty) scientific conferences is pretty energizing. 

I may have more to say about the Blogging Archaeology session, but at the moment I'm sunken under a pile of pending projects.
