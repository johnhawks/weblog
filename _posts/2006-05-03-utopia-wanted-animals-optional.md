In <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/culture/animal_cultures_semiotic_lestel_2002-2006.html">another post</a> I discussed <a href="http://ssi.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/41/1/35">a paper by Dominique Lestel</a> concerning animal cultures.  Lestel closes with this sentiment: 
</p>

<blockquote>I would like to end on a personal note: one thing has always struck me in the organization of the most remarkable utopias of Western literature, and that is the total absence of animals (Lestel 2002:62). </blockquote>

<p>
I guess he doesn't mean <i>Dinotopia</i>...
</p>

<p>
In any event, I also find that interesting. The one exception I can think of offhand is the "Gaia" planet in Asimov's <i>Foundation</i> series, which is pretty explicitly organized along biosemiotic lines, although with the addition of some kind of "superphysical" element (even inanimate objects like mountains are capable of contributing to the "planet-mind" in this utopia). And that makes a strong contrast to the Foundation, which is entirely organized along rational lines, and doesn't -- as far as I can recall -- have any mention of animals. 
</p>

<p>
I'd be interested to make a list of others, if anybody can think of any.
