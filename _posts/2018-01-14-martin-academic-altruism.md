Jenny Martin has recounted a personal story about her first highly cited paper, which followed an altruistic decision from her postdoctoral supervisor, and includes a nice tribute to the late Ben Barres: <a href="https://cubistcrystal-wordpress-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cubistcrystal.wordpress.com/2018/01/05/selfless-in-seattle/amp/">"selfless in seattle"</a>

<blockquote>Actually, this post has nothing to do with Seattle. I just liked the title. The theme, eventually, is science leadership through altruism. But to get there, first I need to relate a story that has been on my mind the past week or two.</blockquote>

It's a good story, and a good lesson about the sources of discoveries.
