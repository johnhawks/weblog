<i>Seed</i> magazine has a very good <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/02/the_reinvention_of_the_self.php?page=all&p=y">summary of neurogenesis and profile of Elizabeth Gould</a> online, by Jonah Lehrer. 
</p>

<blockquote>The structure of our brain, from the details of our dendrites to the density of our hippocampus, is incredibly influenced by our surroundings. Put a primate under stressful conditions, and its brain begins to starve. It stops creating new cells. The cells it already has retreat inwards. The mind is disfigured.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The social implications of this research are staggering. If boring environments, stressful noises, and the primate's particular slot in the dominance hierarchy all shape the architecture of the brain -- and Gould's team has shown that they do -- then the playing field isn't level. Poverty and stress aren't just an idea: they are an anatomy. Some brains never even have a chance.</blockquote>

It's a series of studies in "molecular scars", in which environmental factors have long-lasting effects on gene regulation, in this case inhibiting neuron growth and proliferation.

It's also a good description of the network of scientists studying the effects of long-term stress on the mammalian brain. Very good article.
