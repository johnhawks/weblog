The University of Wisconsin has a news article out on my new position as HHMI Faculty Fellow: <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/20316">"Forest and Hawks named 2012 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Faculty Fellows"</a>.

<blockquote>Hawks is an innovative educator and experienced mentor with a strong commitment to active learning and getting students involved in research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is important to me that science be accessible, and that means that undergraduate students should be trained as creators, not merely consumers, he says.</blockquote>

This is a really engaging program to work with, and we have to potential to do some real research on how biology undergraduate education can be improved. Plus, there's a great group of graduate and postdoctoral students now preparing to run the program in the fall, and it should be fun to mentor them!
