Barbara King joins the Neandertal Anti-Defamation League with her new post at NPR: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2012/03/22/149026578/giving-neanderthals-some-respect-especially-in-an-election-year">"Giving Neanderthals Some Respect (Especially In An Election Year)"</a>.

<blockquote>"Knuckle-dragging Neanderthals!" Every election year, political candidates of all stripes are tarred with this epithet. In a recent column, Washington Post pundit Kathleen Parker asks if it's fair that many U.S. women see the Republican party in precisely those terms. My question: Is that fair to the Neanderthals?</blockquote>

Well, one thing is for sure: If one of the political parties <em>really was</em> Neandertals, they'd do better than the ones we have now!
