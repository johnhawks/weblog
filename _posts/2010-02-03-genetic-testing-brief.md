Data point: 

This is the time in my introductory class when I discuss genetic disorders, and I described <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/business/29gene.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">the new Counsyl test</a> as part of my lecture today. 

I took a quick poll -- how many of my undergraduates would be interested in getting a test that told them their carrier status for a hundred genetic disorders. More than half of them expressed interest. That just seems huge to me -- I don't think I'd have seen the same result ten or even five years ago. There's been a real change in attitude about genetic testing in the last few years as technology has gotten cheaper and has more public attention.
