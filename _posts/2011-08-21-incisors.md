The incisors are the front teeth. They are basically flat and have a blade-like occlusal surface. Each quadrant has two incisors.

In humans and other primates, the upper central incisor (called the <strong>I<sup>1</sup></strong> is typically larger, the lateral (the <strong>I<sup>2</sup></strong>) smaller. 

The lower incisors are small, spatula-shaped teeth, with central (I<sub>1</sub>) and lateral (I<sub>2</sub>) incisors approximately the same size and shape in humans and most primates. 

<h3>What to do:</h3>

At this station you'll find a series of casts of upper dentitions. Some of the incisors have ridges on their mesial and buccal edges, giving them the appearance of a scoop or shovel. These are called "shovel-shaped incisors." This is a trait that varies in human populations, and is more common in people of Asian or Native American ancestry. The casts at this station all represent individuals in a single Native American community in Alaska. 

Seriate these dentitions, in order of how shovel-shaped the central upper incisors appear to you. Once these are in the best order, consider: Does shovel-shaping of the <strong>lateral</strong> incisors (I<sup>2</sup>) go together with the central incisors?
