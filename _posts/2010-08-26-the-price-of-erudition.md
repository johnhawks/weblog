Did you know that the three-volume <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540324747?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3540324747"><i>Handbook of Paleoanthropology</i></a> is a thousand dollars from Amazon? 

A <b>thousand dollars!</b> I thought that the prices of edited volumes had gotten out of control, but wow! I like open access because I know when I write something, I want people to be able to read it without worrying about how to afford it.

Anyway, it looks like the books can be had for $500 from other sellers. Don't know why Amazon is so high. I was looking for one of the articles, and couldn't figure out why the library keeps them on permanent reserve. Guess now I know -- they're too expensive to replace!
