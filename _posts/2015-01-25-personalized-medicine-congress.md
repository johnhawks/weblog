The <em>New York Times</em> reports on the new initiative to fund massive research on personalized medicine: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/us/obama-to-request-research-funding-for-treatments-tailored-to-patients-dna.html">"Obama to Request Research Funding for Treatments Tailored to Patients’ DNA"</a>

<blockquote>The proposal, mentioned briefly in his State of the Union address, will be described in greater detail in his budget in the coming weeks. The effort is likely to receive support from members of both parties, lawmakers said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is an incredible area of promise,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a gastroenterologist. “There will be bipartisan support.”</blockquote>

The article briefly mentions the prospect of Medicare paying for treatments based on patient genotypes. 

It's interesting to see something grow over 10-15 years from the idea of a small group of researchers and venture funders up to a major government initiative. It is a true triumph of marketing in science.
