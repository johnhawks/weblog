Another Geico commercial tonight during college football bowl season: Geico Caveman is playing Scrabble with some famous NFL player. Caveman plays "CAT" and is proud of himself. Football jock plays "NEANDERTHAL". 

The usual huffy indignation ensues. 

I suppose it's not really defamatory...but I've come to expect a certain level of entertainment from the Geico Cavemen, and this just fell far short of my standard.
