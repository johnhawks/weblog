Gordon Watts writes an interesting story of tenure review and the productivity of a long-lasting experiment in particle physics: <a href="http://gordonwatts.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/200-run-2-papers-from-dzero/">"200 Run 2 Papers from DZERO."</a> Let's just say that the <i>journal</i> cuts off access to a university because a single researcher is printing papers for his tenure review! And this:

<blockquote> As far as DZEROs ability to mark passing time, there are 18 people that have helped this experiment and didnt live to see the 200th paper. </blockquote>
