It's a minor deluge, but I have some extra traffic today from Instapundit, linked to the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/hunting/barbaric_yawping_neandertal_women_2006.html">barbaric yawping post</a>. I'm still waiting on the cannibalism paper to come out in <i>PNAS</i> before I write much about it, so I hope you'll all come back often!

This is helping a lot to get up to a million visits in 2006, which is pretty great for this anthropology blog. So keep clicking over!

Also, I'm <a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/">nominated for the 2006 Weblog Awards</a> in the category of Best Science Blog. Voting hasn't started yet, but when it does I'll post a link. I don't have anything like the traffic of some of the big ones, but I know that I have some very loyal readers!
