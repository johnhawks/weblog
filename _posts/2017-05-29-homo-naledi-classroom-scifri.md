This is a neat feature from NPR's <em>Science Friday</em> giving resources for teachers who want to include the SciFri episode on <em>Homo naledi</em> as part of their classroom exercises: <a href="https://medium.com/science-friday-spoonfuls/where-does-homo-naledi-fit-into-our-family-tree-44cdabbd77a5">"Where does Homo naledi fit into our family tree?"</a>.

It includes alignments with science standards for U.S. K-12 teachers.

<blockquote>Have students compare and contrast different hominid skulls using these drawings and timeline. Where does <em>Homo naledi</em> fit in? How does it compare to other hominid skulls? Using the diagrams and figures in this article about the Homo naledi discovery, relate your skull observations to how <em>Homo naledi</em> alters our view of the human evolutionary tree.</blockquote>

We've sure come a long way in a few years!
