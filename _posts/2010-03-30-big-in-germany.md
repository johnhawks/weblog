Hmmm...

A couple of years ago I thought I was really special when creationist literature started calling me a "noted evolutionist". As in, "even noted evolutionist John Hawks admits...." You get the idea. 

Now in Germany I've apparently become <a href="http://www.shortnews.de/id/823762/Neue-Menschenart-in-Sibirien-War-es-das-mythische-Wesen-Yeti">a noted cryptozoologist</a>.

Many thanks to my readers, especially those who know the difference between an Almas and a Yeti.
