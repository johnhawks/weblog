Jerry Pournelle, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XTKFWW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004XTKFWW&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20"><em>A Step Farther Out</em> ($2.99 on Kindle)</a>: 

<blockquote>Science writers have a problem; how much detail do we include, and how technical can we get? After all, our first purpose is to entertain; if we can't do that, there's no point in writing a column or article for the general public. On the other hand, there's buried in most of us a frustrated teacher: we want the readers to <em>understand</em> and even to be able to work these things out for themselves.</blockquote>
