Barbara King on the NPR "Cosmos and Culture" blog reviews the children's book about evolution, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0986288403/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0986288403&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkId=CAQNG25QFY4ZJUGH"><em>Grandmother Fish: a child's first book of Evolution</em></a>: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/10/29/452848537/a-childs-first-book-of-evolution">"When Should You Introduce A Child To Evolution?"</a>. 

<blockquote>All life on earth is related. The way children wiggle, breathe, cuddle and grab objects can help them to realize their ancient link with fish, reptiles, mammals and apes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is the message of Grandmother Fish, a new book for 3- to 7-year-olds written by Jonathan Tweet and illustrated by Karen Lewis. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign and offered free in PDF form online, the book has won praise as a child's first book of evolution.</blockquote>

I love that you can <a href="http://www.grandmotherfish.com">get <em>Grandmother Fish</em> in PDF form online</a>, and the book's website has some great background about how the author worked with the National Center for Science Education to build in accuracy (e.g., <a href="http://www.grandmotherfish.com/uncategorized/ape-feet-and-people-feet/">"Ape feet and people feet"</a>).
