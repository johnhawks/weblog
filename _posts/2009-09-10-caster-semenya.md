Is there such a thing as <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,549021,00.html">"failing" a gender test</a>?

<blockquote>A source closely involved with the IAAF tests said Semenya had internal testes  the male sexual organs that produce testosterone, according to the Telegraph.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a result, the IAAF could disqualify the South African from future events and strip her of her gold medal, the newspaper reported.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But IAAF spokesman Nick Davies told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Semenya is likely to keep her gold.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no automatic disqualification of results in a case like this," Davies said. "This is not a doping case at present, so it shouldn't be considered as one where you have a retroactive stripping of results."</blockquote>

None of the reports I've found say anything about karyotype. The spokesman's comments raise the question of culpability versus performance advantage. Semenya's testosterone-fueled development is arguably a competitive advantage over other women. But she's done nothing wrong; she did not seek out this advantage. Yet girls in many countries diagnosed with internal testes would usually have them surgically removed -- would their parents refuse the surgery if it neutralized a possible sports career? What triggers eligibility, anyway? 

UPDATE (2009-09-14): A reader writes: 

<blockquote>[T]he answer to be found in her name "Caster Semenya?" : "A secret man? Yes".</blockquote>

Spooky.
