In _Proof_, the _National Geographic_ photography blog, Stephen Alvarez describes his experience photographing the famous cave art of Chauvet Cave for the January 2015 issue: <a href="http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/01/05/shooting-chauvet-photographing-the-worlds-oldest-cave-art/">"Shooting Chauvet: Photographing the World’s Oldest Cave Art"</a>. 

<blockquote>Preparing to photograph in Chauvet, I thought carefully about what my role should be. I am the only non-scientific photographer to shoot Chauvet this decade. It’s closed to all but a handful of researchers. That knowledge gave me a tremendous sense of responsibility. It also left me with a strong feeling of connection to those Paleolithic artists. I wanted to photograph the paintings in a way that let the original artists’ voice come through while also preserving the sense of what it is like to stand in front of that art.</blockquote>
