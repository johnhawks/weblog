<em>Smithsonian</em> is running a profile of geneticist Pardis Sabeti, written by Seth Mnookin: <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Pardis-Sabeti-the-Rollerblading-Rock-Star-Scientist-of-Harvard-179988881.html">"Pardis Sabeti, the Rollerblading Rock Star Scientist of Harvard"</a>. 

<blockquote>It was a radical approach: Instead of using existing tools to analyze new data, she was trying to develop new tools to use on available data. When she was at Oxford, Everybody thought what I was trying to look for was dumb, Sabeti says. It seemed as if I was just going to go nowhere. I know everyone has a hard time at some point when theyre in graduate school, but I was on the higher end of the hard time early on in my PhD.</blockquote>

Sabeti's work identifying recent positive selection on genetic data served as an essential foundation to much later work, including <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/acceleration/accel_story_2007.html">our own work on the Holocene acceleration of these positively selected variants.</a>
