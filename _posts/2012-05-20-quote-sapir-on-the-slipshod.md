From Edward Sapir's response to Alfred Kroeber's 1917 essay on "The Superorganic" <bib>Sapir:superorganic:1917</bib>: 

<blockquote>Nothing irritates a student of culture more than to have the methods of the exact sciences flaunted in his face as a salutary antidote to his own supposedly slipshod methods.</blockquote>
