Jonathan Jones muses on two exhibitions of Leonardo's work, one on paintings and the other on anatomical drawings (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/may/01/leonardo-da-vinci-artist-or-scientist">"Is Leonardo da Vinci a great artist or a great scientist?"</a>): 

<blockquote>Yet every vein he draws is a miracle of art. He is never more an artist than when he is most a scientist. Even as he patiently reveals the nature of heart valves, he draws with such tender beauty that you gasp at the complex artistic achievement, the subtle textures and three-dimensional illusions, even as you marvel at his insights into the human body. For me, Leonardo's anatomical drawings are both icons of science, and wonders of art.</blockquote>
