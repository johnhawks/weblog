More from <a href="http://www.popsci.com/archive">the <i>Popular Science</i> archive</a>, in the January 1929 issue: "What the World Owes to 1929." Writing the short "Anthropology" summary was Ales Hrdli&#269;ka. 

<blockquote>Weidenreich published the first account of the highly interesting new Ehringsdorf skull. Miss Garrod, Buxton, and Elliot Smith reported on the new Mousterian find, including a child's skull, of Gibraltar. And Hrdli&#269;ka in his Huxley lecture showed that in the light of present evidence science is no more justified in excluding the Neanderthal man from our ancestry.</blockquote>

Great that he could fit himself in there, in the third person. And yet, out of the stuff from 1929, Hrdli&#269;ka's lecture probably was the most enduring, and the others that he listed really were important. 

Oh, and the thing starts with a tiny woodcut:

I love that little guy!
