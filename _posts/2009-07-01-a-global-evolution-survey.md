From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/jul/01/evolution"><i>The Guardian</i></a>, via a reader: 

<blockquote><b>God or Darwin? The world in evolution beliefs</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Find out where on earth only 8% of people believe in evolution</blockquote>

The listing includes 10 countries, polled by The British Council, who have released the study to publicize <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/darwin-about-us.htm">a website called "Darwin Now"</a>. I suppose the title of "evolution leader" depends on how you interpret the poll. China has the greatest percentage who "agree that the scientific evidence for evolution exists," at 55 percent. But they also have a surprising number (19 percent) who think that "evolution should NOT be taught, only other theories." 

Only 9 percent of American respondents thought that evolution should not be taught, but only 33 percent agreed that evidence for evolution exists. That puts us behind Mexico and India, but way ahead of South Africa and Egypt -- those places on Earth where only 8 percent agree that evidence for evolution exists.
