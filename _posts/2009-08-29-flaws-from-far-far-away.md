John Scalzi snarks out the design flaws of science fiction movies this week. First <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2009/08/bad-designs-in-star-wars.php"><i>Star Wars</i></a>: 

<blockquote><b>That Asteroid Worm Thing in Empire Strikes Back</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>So, large space worm lives in asteroid, disguises itself as a cave and waits for unwary spaceships to fly by so it can eat them? Makes the Sarlaac look like a marvel of natural selection, it does.</blockquote>

Then <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2009/08/bad-designs-in-star-trek.php"><i>Star Trek</i></a>: 

<blockquote><b>The Borg</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Featured in First Contact, these are the most fearsome aliens in the galaxy, and look like the Tin Man on Goth Night at the local leather bar.</blockquote>

UPDATE (2009-08-29): Oh, and there's <a href="http://www.troutman.org/humor/startrek.html">this</a>.
