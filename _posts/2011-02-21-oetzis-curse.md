I did not know there was an <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110221/world-news/iceman-oetzi-gets-a-new-face-for-20th-century">iceman mummy curse: </a>

<blockquote>But Oetzi's notoriety has also been linked to a supposed curse surrounding the mummy, after several people -- authors, researchers, even mountain guides -- who came in contact with it died over the years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One of the couple who discovered Oetzi was found dead after a mountain hike in 2004. A forensic expert, who had closely examined the find, meanwhile died in a car accident in 1992 on his way to a lecture about Oetzi.</blockquote>

Well, sounds more like coincidence...<i>so far!</i> But maybe there's a movie script here.
