Larry Moran posts a bit of Darwin history, focusing on a meeting with William Gladstone <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2012/02/happy-birthday-charles-darwin.html">"Happy Birthday Charles Darwin"</a>. 

<blockquote>Our quiet, however, was broken a couple of days ago by Gladstone calling here.I never saw him before & was much pleased with him: I expected a stern, overwhelming sort of man, but found him as soft & smooth as butter, & very pleasant. </blockquote>
