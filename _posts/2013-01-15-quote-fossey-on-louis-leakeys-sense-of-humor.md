Dian Fossey, writing in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061808360X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=061808360X"><em>Gorillas in the Mist</em></a> about her recruitment to study the mountain gorilla:

<blockquote>Our conversation ended with his assertion that it was mandatory I should have my appendix removed before venturing into the remote wilderness of the gorillas' high altitude habitat in central Africa. I would have agreed to almost anything at that point and promptly made plans for an appendectomy. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Some six weeks later on returning home from the hospital sans appendix, I found a letter from Dr. Leakey. It began, "Actully there really isn't any dire need for you to have your appendix removed. That is only my way of testing applicants' determination!" This was my first introduction to Dr. Leakey's unique sense of humor.</blockquote>
