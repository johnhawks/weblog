The White House is looking to recognize people who are leading in open science efforts, either by providing free access to data or by using data that is already publicly available. I imagine that public education efforts using open data would also qualify for this recognition: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/07/seeking-outstanding-open-science-champions-change">"Seeking Outstanding 'Open Science' Champions of Change"</a>. The reward is a trip to a White House event June 20. 

<blockquote>We are asking for your help to identify Open Science Champions of Changeoutstanding individuals, organizations, or research projects promoting and using open scientific data for the benefit of society. For example, a Champions work may involve:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Providing free access to data or publications generated from scientific research; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leading research that uses publically available scientific data.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anyone can nominate an Open Science candidate for consideration by May 23, 2013 (under Theme of Service, choose Open Science). In the Reason for Nominating section of the nomination form, please also include information about any upcoming open-science-related announcements or new steps that the individual or organization you are nominating has planned, which could potentially be launched at the Champions of Change event.</blockquote>

I just found out about this process this morning, but it looks like a constructive step in recognizing people who are moving science in a more open direction. Earlier this year, the White House recommended a new policy on data access, which I found to be very helpful in comparison to the concurrent policy on publication access <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/data-access-white-house-2013.html">"White House policy on data access"</a>. 

Nominations for this honor are due tomorrow (Thursday), using the short <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/nominate">online nomination form</a>. I hope many worthy people can be recognized in this way!
