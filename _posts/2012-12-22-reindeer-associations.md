Alice Roberts ponders the prehistory of people and reindeer: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/23/reindeer-rudolph-siberia-love-story">"Rudolph and our early ancestors  a love story"</a>. 

<blockquote>The end of the ice age saw a massive global extinction: many large mammals fell prey to changing climate and the effect of some rather formidable hunters sharing their landscape. There was a decline in the genetic diversity of reindeer after the peak of the last ice age 20,000 years ago  probably due to a warming climate as well as those palaeolithic hunters  but reindeer survived, and thankfully they don't look likely to become extinct any time soon.</blockquote>
