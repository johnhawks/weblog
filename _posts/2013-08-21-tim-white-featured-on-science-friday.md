Last week, Science Friday posted <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/08/09/2013/desktop-diaries-tim-white.html">a great video interview with paleoanthropologist Tim White</a>. The interview is part of their "Desktop Diaries" series, in which famous scientists share some stories behind the objects around them.

I totally love the part where he talks about preparing fossils with a garden hose!
