The latest entry on the Rising Star Expedition blog is a link to the National Geographic Weekend radio show, in which Lee Berger tells the story of the discovery from beginning to end. <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/09/a-voice-from-the-cave-lee-berger-on-the-ng-weekend-radio-show/">"A Voice From the Cave: Lee Berger on the NG Weekend Radio Show"</a> 



<blockquote>Over the course of the three-week-long Rising Star Expedition in November, Lee Berger posted individual updates by the minute on Twitter, and we had blog posts and videos almost daily, revealing chapters of the story right as they happened.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Now that the field season has wrapped theres been time to look back and see the story as a whole, from Pedro Boshoff's original commission to seek out new fossil sites in the caves of the Cradle of Humankind, to the phenomenal final tally of more than a thousand hominid fossil elements discovered and identified.</blockquote>



It's highly recommended!
