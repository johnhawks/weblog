Larry Moran <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/07/gene-wiki.html">comments on the Gene Wiki</a>. (If you haven't read about it, check out <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25621634/">this AP article</a>, or <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060175">the <i>PLoS Biology</i> paper</a>). Larry has <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/06/errors-in-sequence-databases.html">written before</a> about the errors in sequence databases and how hard it is to fix them, he's one of the people with the most practical experience trying to find ways to remove errors. 

His posts are a good way to learn about the limits of these resources. I've seen several cases where incorrect data made it into a database and proliferated through the literature. These cases are extremely hard to root out once they get in. Errors are inevitable -- sometimes things just aren't the way they look. The wiki concept does provide a chance to fix things, or at least a place for annotations of existing errors, as long as credible people are doing the annotations. 

I think that the baseline may have the potential as a foundation for a wiki about recent selection on human genes.
