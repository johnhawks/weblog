This lecture covers the evolution of human brain size with its energetic and developmental consequences. I focus on the different pattern of early childhood development in humans relative to other primates and our extended childhood which is characterized by relatively slow growth in size but continued learning and brain maturation. The differences in the pattern of brain growth in Neandertals and recent people come into the end of the lecture.
