From the <i>New York Times</i> story about Caster Semenya, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/sports/20runner.html?emc=eta1">"Gender Test After a Gold-Medal Finish"</a>:

<blockquote>Weiss said that <b>the two-pronged investigation</b> was being conducted in South Africa and in Berlin in hospitals that specialize in sex-testing issues.</blockquote>
