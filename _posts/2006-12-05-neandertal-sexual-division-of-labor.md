<p>
I've been reading the new paper by Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner about Neandertal versus modern human organizational strategies. I'm taking a lot of notes about it, and have several reactions.
</p>

<p>
But first, let me just say this: ten years ago, we were arguing about whether Neandertals could hunt at all, or whether instead <b>they were ineffective scavengers depending on carnivore handouts</b>.
</p>

<p>
I suppose those days must be behind us, because now we read Neandertals were such committed big game hunters that they <b>needed their females and kids to hunt along with them</b>, which fatally compromised their ability to find and exploit small animals and plant foods.
</p>

<p>
Apparently it took some <b>tropical mojo</b> to make modern women realize they could eat plant foods like every other primate.
</p>

<p>
But then, one wonders how the Sima de los Huesos women <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/55002194/ABSTRACT">managed to do</a> what Neandertals couldn't...
</p>

UPDATE (12/5/2006): If you've come over by a link to this post, I have followed up with <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/hunting/neandertal-women-hunting-kuhn-stiner-2006.html">a second post</a> that goes through the paper's argument in detail and provides some criticism. In case it wasn't obvious above, I think this idea doesn't work to explain Neandertal social behavior.
