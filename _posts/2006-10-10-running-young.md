On the subject of <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/minds/memory/hundred_thousand_digits_of_pi_2006.html">insane feats of endurance</a>, please allow me to draw your attention to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2387049,00.html">this story</a> about extreme children endurance runners: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Marathon children collapse in a copycat race for glory</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>From Ashling O'Connor in Bombay</blockquote>

<blockquote>A TEN-YEAR-OLD girl from a remote village in eastern India has become the country's latest under-age long-distance runner in a growing craze that has prompted allegations of abuse and exploitation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anastasia Barla ran 72 kilometres (45 miles) in the state of Orissa on Monday in sweltering heat before she was forced to stop because of exhaustion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The girl had been attempting to break the 100km barrier in an effort to outshine Budhia Singh, the four-year-old boy who made world headlines in May when he covered a distance of 65 kilometres in seven hours and two minutes.</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, that is not a misprint. A <i>four-year-old</i> boy.
</p>

<p>
The story mentions other children sent to intensive care after their own attempts on the record. 
</p>

<p>
Now, I know someone will want to make the point that this proves that humans have evolved to be endurance athletes. I will believe that as soon as I find the gland that we evolved to secrete our internal store of high-sugar energy drinks. (I will call it, the Gator-Nipple&#174;). Because without a whole lot of water and sugar, there is <i>no chance</i> that a kid could go more than a few miles. 
</p>

<p>
And then there is this: 
</p>

<blockquote>Marathon experts maintain that children under 10 should not run more than 15 miles a week. </blockquote>

<p>
Well, that's a relief...er, um, fifteen miles a week? May I just say that "marathon experts" are <i>in-sane!</i>
