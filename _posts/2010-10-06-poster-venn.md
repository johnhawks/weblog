I love the <a href="http://betterposters.blogspot.com/2010/09/poster-venn.html">Poster Venn diagram"</a> from Better Posters -- stuff people usually put on academic posters intersected with what viewers care about. So I won't cut and paste the diagram, just <a href="http://betterposters.blogspot.com/2010/09/poster-venn.html">go see it</a>. 

Some good advice at that site for people designing poster presentations, and hopefully more will keep coming. It's a resource badly needed.
