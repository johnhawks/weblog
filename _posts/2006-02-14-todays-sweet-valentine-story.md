<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11346164">Couples really do look like each other</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Researchers set out to investigate why couples often tend to resemble one another. They asked 11 male and 11 female participants to judge the age, attractiveness and personality traits of 160 real-life married couples. Photographs of husbands and wives were viewed separately, so the participants didn't know who was married to whom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The test participants rated men and woman who were actual couples as looking alike and having similar personalities. Also, the longer the couples had been together, the greater the perceived similarities.</blockquote>

<p>
The article attributes the similarity to similar experiences, facial expressions, and testosterone.

OK, that's not so romantic. Personally, I think it's 50 percent assortative mating, and 50 percent fat.
