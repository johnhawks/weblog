Courtesy of Jon Cohen in <i>Science</i> (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.328.5974.35">"The Chimpanzee Genome Project's Seedy Origins"</a>), a detail that I hadn't heard before: 

<blockquote>To begin, [Pieter] de Jong asked Yerkes for a sample of chimp sperm, and researchers there chose Clintnot because he was a hardy male representative of Pan troglodytes or had some other meaningful attribute. Clint, it turns out, became the genome chimp because he was particularly fond of providing sperm samples.</blockquote>

Apparently it all started with Evan Eichler, who needed to make a bacterial artificial chromosome with chimpanzee X chromosome sequence.
