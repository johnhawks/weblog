I was reviewing my log files, and discovered that a lot of new readers are coming from <i>Science</i> magazine, which very kindly <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol311/issue5767/netwatch.dtl">put me in their NetWatch feature</a> last week!
</p>

<blockquote>WEB LOG: Bones, Genes, And Brains</blockquote>

<blockquote>A study suggesting that <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/minds/stress_molecular_scar_2006.html">social stress leaves "molecular scars"</a> on the brain and research exposing <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/culture/apes/gorilla_zoo_cultures_2006.html">cultural diversity in gorillas</a> are just two of the subjects that have snared the interest of anthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His wide-ranging blog excavates novel ideas and noteworthy discoveries in evolution, genetics, and human paleontology. Hawks promises to deliver three to five essays per week. Gems he's come across include a recent New York Times piece about the Soviet Union's <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/history/king_kong_soviet_humanzee_2005.html">unsuccessful efforts</a> in the 1920s to prove our simian ancestry by crossbreeding chimps with humans. Readers intrigued by the tiny Flores hominid uncovered in Indonesia 2 years ago will find <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/">a section devoted to the controversial remains</a>.</blockquote>

Too cool! I added the links in the above quote in case anybody's looking for those specific pages. Welcome to everybody who's come by, and please come back as often as you like!
