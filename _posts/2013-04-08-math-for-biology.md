Edward O. Wilson, in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> writes: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323611604578398943650327184.html">"Great Scientist ? Good at Math"</a>. 

<blockquote>For many young people who aspire to be scientists, the great bugbear is mathematics. Without advanced math, how can you do serious work in the sciences? Well, I have a professional secret to share: Many of the most successful scientists in the world today are mathematically no more than semiliterate.</blockquote>

Wilson takes himself as the canonical model. Razib Khan comments somewhat critically (<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2013/04/does-one-need-math-for-a-career-in-science/">"Does one need math for a career in science?"</a>). I think that field biology requires working diligently and independently in the field in a way that some kinds of science do not, and personal qualities that set successful fieldworkers apart are pretty much orthogonal to math skill.
