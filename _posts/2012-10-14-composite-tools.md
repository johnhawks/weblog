What if you took flaked stone implements, scanned them in three dimensions, designed specially fitted accessories, which you then printed with a 3-d printer and assembled into a composite? <a href="http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/24124/modern-stone-flint-tools-by-ami-drach-dov-ganchrow.html">"modern stone + flint tools by ami drach + dov ganchrow"</a>.

<blockquote>through a method of three-dimensionally scanning and printing, the ancient artifacts are digitally outfitted with custom-designed handles, encapsulating the rugged forms in a perfectly enclosed case. by juxtaposing the polarities of the manufacturing processes in computer generated forms, an intersection of material technologies and functionality coincide on a tangible scale.</blockquote>

These are elegant and well-designed, truly art. Still, despite the fancy fabrication, the concept itself was known to the Neandertals.
