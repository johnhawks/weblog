A brief report earlier this month from Agence France-Presse describes a new discovery of <i>Ugandapithecus</i>, worked on by Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford: <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-08-million-year-old-ape-skull-unearthed-uganda.html">"20-million-year-old ape skull unearthed in Uganda".</a>

<blockquote>"This is the first time that the complete skull of an ape of this age has been found ... it is a highly important fossil and it will certainly put Uganda on the map in terms of the scientific world," Martin Pickford, a paleontologist from the College de France in Paris, told journalists in Kampala.</blockquote>

<i>Ugandapithecus</i> is a large Early Miocene ape, probably related to <i>Proconsul</i>. A 2009 paper by Pickford and colleagues <bib>Pickford:Ugandapithecus:2009</bib> (open access) does a nice job of showing the anatomy with photographs and describing how the different samples of <i>Ugandapithecus</i>, some of which represent different species, differ from <i>Proconsul</i>. It will be very interesting to see how the new skull adds to the record of this ape genus.
