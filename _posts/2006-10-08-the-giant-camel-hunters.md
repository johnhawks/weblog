<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/world/middleeast/08camel.html">This</a> is from Reuters: 
</p>

<blockquote>Swiss researchers have discovered the 100,000-year-old remains of a previously unknown giant camel species in central Syria.</blockquote>

<p>
The big camel was "12 feet tall," which they are comparing to giraffes and elephants. In other words, megafauna. Megafauna hunted by humans:
</p>

<blockquote>A group of humans apparently killed the camel while it was drinking from a spring, said Professor [Jean-Marie Le] Tensorer, adding that human remains from the same period were discovered nearby at the once water-rich site.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A human bone, taken to Switzerland for anthropological analysis, was of a <i>Homo sapiens</i>, or modern man, the professor said, but a tooth was similar to that of a Neanderthal. "We dont know yet what it is exactly," he said. "Do we have a very old <i>Homo sapiens</i> or a Neanderthal?"</blockquote>

Another version of <a href="http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Remains_of_giant_camel_discovered_in_Syria.html?siteSect=143&sid=7138295&cKey=1160157326000">the report</a> at Swissinfo.org has this: 
</p>

<blockquote>Kowm, the site where the remains were discovered along with flint and stone weapons, is a 20-km (14 mile) wide gap between two mountain ranges that had a number of springs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The site, which was first surveyed in the 1960s and where evidence of a 1 million-year-old human settlement has been found, is considered a "reference for early prehistory in the Near East", Basel University said in a recent research paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It attracted migrating herds, such as antelope, and man. Archaeological layers covering a period of several hundreds of thousands of years were discovered, which is unusual for such an open site, he said.</blockquote>

<p>
OK. Now, if either modern humans or Neandertals could hunt and kill giant camels in Syria, why exactly do we need a "southern route" theory?
