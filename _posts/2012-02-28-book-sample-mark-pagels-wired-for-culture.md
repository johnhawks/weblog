I've just bought a new book by Mark Pagel, titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393065871/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393065871"><em>Wired for Culture: Origins of the Human Social Mind</em></a>. I'll be doing a review when I get through it, but in the meantime, I noticed that I can now embed samples of Kindle books right here on my own website. 

Those with larger screens could handle a larger embed here, but I've tried to strike a compromise that will not be too terrible on small screens, since unlike my photos, this can't scale with device size. If you click on the "expand screen" icon, it will grow to take up your browser screen, which I find most effective on the iPad and iPhone.

The sample runs through the preface, introduction and prologue of the book.
