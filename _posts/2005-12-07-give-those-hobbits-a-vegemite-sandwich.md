<blockquote>The startling claim comes from archaeologist Mike Morwood, leader of the team that in 2003 uncovered remains of the 1m-tall hominid at Liang Bua cave on Indonesia's Flores island.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is seriously being discussed now by the archaeological community in Australia as a result of our work in Indonesia," Professor Morwood said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He suggested that further field work at sites in Indonesia and northern Australia could provide answers.</blockquote>
