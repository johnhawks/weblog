A beautiful bit of medical anthropology by med student Shara Yurkiewicz: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/this-may-hurt-a-bit/2013/03/13/good-patients-cover-their-emotional-cracks/">"'Good patients' cover their emotional cracks"<a/>

<blockquote>My father sees a famous cardiologist, and he rarely asks questions.  For the past three years I have criticized him for this.  Whats the point of having a good doctor if youre afraid to ask about how hes treating you? I would chide him after every appointment.  He didnt want to frustrate the doctor and compromise his care.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In response, I uttered every cliche in the book.  First, I denied that this would happen.  (Im sure hes seen much worse.)  Then I conceded that if it did, he could just find a new doctor.  (Forget how famous he is.)  I ended with my usual tough love: Its your life.  Youre the one whos living with the illness, not him.  A half dozen of these conversations later, my dad is thankfully healthy but neither I nor he can explain exactly how his care is being managed.</blockquote>

A lot of emotion and perspectives through the eyes of other med students and patients in the essay.
