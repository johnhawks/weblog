I happened across this great quote by Marcel Otte, referring to the Bordes-Binford debate among other archaeological donnybrooks:

<blockquote>The fastidious descriptions of European lithic assemblages have led to different and often contradictory interpretations&mdash;lyric or pathetic&mdash;that seem ultimately to be reflections of irreconcilable personal obsessions (Otte 2003:46).</blockquote>
