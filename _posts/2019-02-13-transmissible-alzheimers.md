Jennifer Frazer writes on the <em>Scientific American</em> blog site: <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/the-case-for-transmissible-alzheimers-grows/">"The Case for Transmissible Alzheimer's Grows"</a>.

It's a very scary story if true:

<blockquote>Indeed, two types of Aβ [beta amyloid peptides] and tau were still present in the vials, even after more than three decades of room temperature storage. Aβ and tau, at least, are survivors too.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This team took their study a step further by injecting a tiny sample of these vintage vials into the brains of mice engineered to be susceptible to human Alzheimer’s. The mice developed both Aβ plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although they showed no signs of tau. Aβ peptides had not only managed to survive decades of room-temeprature storage, they were also still transmissible. This is concerning.</blockquote>

Among other things, there's a suggestion that prions and possibly Alzheimer's-related peptides on surgical equipment might transmit associated disorders by means of surgeries. It's a scary idea. The medical research establishment unfortunately has poorly in the past at examining the hypothesis that pathogens are associated with chronic disease.
