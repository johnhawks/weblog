<blockquote><b>Natural History Museum returns bones of 138 Torres Strait Islanders</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Tears of joy as human remains are repatriated to natives of islands located between Australia and Papua New Guinea</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most, ranging from a jaw to full skeletons, have been in England since the mid 19th century. Some came back as sailors' souvenirs, some were collected by the surgeon of the British survey ship Rattlesnake, some were bought or traded among the first European visitors.</blockquote>

According to the story, the bones are not to be reburied, at least not immediately, and may be studied by researchers in conjunction with Torres Strait Island natives.
