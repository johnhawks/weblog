<blockquote>To be honest, I've only ever liked the Fall Back bit of DST, where we gain an hour of sleep. I propose that we forget the Spring Ahead nonsense and instead Fall Back twice a year: once in spring, once in autumn. In this respect, we will gain an hour of sleep two times in a 365-day period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, if we increased the frequency of backfalling and, say, Fell Back every two months (and who would turn down 60 free sleep minutes), over the course of 4 years, we will have gained an entire 24 hours. Then, we could do away with Leap Year.</blockquote>
