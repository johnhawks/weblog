<blockquote>In a new study of college undergraduates, those with a common genetic variation scored 20 percent worse in a driving simulator than their counterparts.</blockquote>

Hmmm....

<blockquote>As described in a paper published in the journal <i>Cerebral Cortex</i>, study participants were asked to drive 16 laps in a driving simulator that was essentially a screen with a steering wheel. As they drove around the course, they attempted to keep their cars on a black strip in the center of the road. The software grades their ability to complete that task quantitatively. And, of a small sample of 29 students, people with that single genetic difference, called Val66Met, performed more poorly than their demographically similar counterparts.</blockquote>

<i>n</i>=29 does not give me much confidence...
