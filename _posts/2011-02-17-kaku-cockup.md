I can't bear to watch it again, and I don't see why I should tolerate anyone else having to watch it. But I can't sit quietly while <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/26912">physicist Michio Kaku tells us how human evolution has stopped.</a>

I'm telling you, don't go watch it. DON'T DO IT!

Oh, heck, how did that get there?

Don't press play, whatever you do. I'm warning you.

Kaku wants to tell you all about how life in the forest used to make us run fast, but now we don't have to do that anymore. He says that life on isolated island continents, like Australia, would rapidly accelerate our evolution. But today jet planes will spread your genes across the world, so our evolution has stopped.

Or, no, it's not <i>all</i> our evolution that's stopped -- Kaku says that's still going on because our molecules can change. No, it's <i>gross</i> evolution that has stopped. You know, like making our brains twice as big -- that would be <i>gross</i>.

What about genetic engineering, you ask? Well, Kaku says that changing genes is very painful. And we can't make pigs with wings, so why would we bother? No, many decades from now, humans will look pretty much the way they do now.

Well, you can't say I didn't warn you. That's today's "Big Think" for you -- timely news you can use. But no flying pigs.

DERP!

UPDATE (2017-02-26): This post originally appeared in February, 2011. For some reason, this video has started making the rounds again, <strong>six years after it was originally uploaded</strong>. It isn't any better or more accurate today.

This raises an interesting issue: what is the half-life of fake information on the internet? In my opinion, a site like "Big Think" should be actively curating these videos so that it is presenting current and scientifically accurate information. Kaku's video was wrong when it was released in 2011, and a number of real evolutionary biologists pointed this out.

Now, in 2017, the video has racked up more than 1.6 million views on YouTube. Who knows how many saw it through the original Big Think site?
