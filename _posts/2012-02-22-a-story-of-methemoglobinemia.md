A story by Susan Donaldson James of a unique genetic disorder and the social stigma of inbreeding in Appalachia: <a href="http://gma.yahoo.com/fugates-kentucky-skin-bluer-lake-louise-200247843--abc-news.html">"Fugates of Kentucky: Skin Bluer than Lake Louise"</a>. 

<blockquote>By the time reports appeared in the media on the disorder, the Stacy family was upset with insinuations about in-breeding that fed into stereotypes of backwoods Appalachia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was a pain not seen in lab tests," wrote Trost. "That was the pain of being blue in a world that is mostly shades of white to black."</blockquote>

The disorder involves an excess of methemoglobin in the blood, related to the examples I've been relating in my <a href="http://johnhawks.net/courses/principles">Anthropology 105 course</a> the last week or so.
