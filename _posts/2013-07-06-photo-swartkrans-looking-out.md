I'm in South Africa this month doing some work, so I haven't had time to post quite as often as usual. In the meantime, I will share a few photos as I go. Monday I visited Swartkrans Cave with Travis Pickering, who is the lead scientist working there. It was a great visit and I got some incredible footage that will be part of the MOOC. 

Here's a photo of the deeper part of the cave, looking out. The tree there at the opening is very much like what Bob Brain reconstructed as the environment at the time the hominin fossils accumulated at the site. Leopards sometimes carried their hominin prey up into such trees, letting bones fall below into the cave where they gathered in several episodes over a million years.
