As long as I'm linking to the <i>Daily Mail</i> for their <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/neandertal-metrosexuals-2010.html">"Neanderthal metrosexuals" quip</a>, I thought I'd pass along a story I liked -- <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-1242766/Dont-eat-cereals-change-colour-milk-Unlikely-brilliantly-simple-rules-transform-way-eat.html">"Unlikely but brilliantly simple rules to transform the way we eat"</a> from dilemmistic omnivore Michael Pollan. 

<blockquote>The whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead</blockquote>

There are maybe twenty of these little guidelines, mostly clever but not generally rhyming. My favorite: 

<blockquote>It's not food if it has the same name in all languages.</blockquote>

Explanation: "Think Big Mac or Pringles."
