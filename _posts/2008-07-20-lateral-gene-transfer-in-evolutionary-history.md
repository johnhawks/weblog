Carl Zimmer <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/07/17/festooning-the-tree-of-life/">describes</a> a recent paper documenting lateral gene transfer across a broad phylogeny of organisms. It's one of the topics covered in his book, <i>Microcosm</i>, and his post has some very cool pictures.
