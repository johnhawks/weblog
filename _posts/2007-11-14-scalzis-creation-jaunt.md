John Scalzi's readers <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/creation/scalzi_creation_museum_2007.html">ponied up</a> for him to visit the Creation Museum and post his reactions. Well, <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=121">he's done it,</a> and it's darned funny. Funny, but not pretty: 
</p>

<blockquote>Let me say this much: I have to admit admiration for the pure balls-out, high-octane creationism that's on offer here. Not for the Creation Museum that mamby-pamby weak sauce known as "Intelligent Design," which tries to slip God by as some random designer, who just sort of got the ball rolling by accident. Screw that, pal: The Creation Museums God is hands on! He made every one of those animals from the damn mud and he did it no earlier than 4004 BC, or thereabouts. Its all there in the book, son, all you have to do is look.</blockquote>

<p>
That's the paragraph that didn't need censoring. Don't <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=121">go over there</a> if you're a creationist; you won't like it. 
</p>

<p>
Oh, and if you're home-schooling, don't <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=121">send your kids there</a> either, unless you can handle many repetitions of the word "horse***t". 
</p>

<p>
Don't say I didn't warn you...
