I'm going on <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">Radio Open Source</a> in a few minutes for a show about genetic genealogy. If your public radio station carries it, you can tune in, or you can stream it off the internet. 
</p>

<p>
UPDATE: Well, that was a lot of fun. Great conversation with the host Christopher Lydon and Spencer Wells, and their other guests also had a lot of interesting things to say regarding Jewish patrilines and African American ancestry. I especially liked the distinction between ancestry and heritage brought up by the final interview -- ancestry is who you are, heritage contributes to who you choose to be.

You can listen to the show by podcast, linked <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">at the site</a>.
