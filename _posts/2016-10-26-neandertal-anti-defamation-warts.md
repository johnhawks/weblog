<a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/modern-genital-warts-came-from-ancestors-sleeping-with-neanderthals">This, from ScienceAlert</a>:

<blockquote><strong>We caught modern genital warts because our ancestors were banging Neanderthals</strong></blockquote>

Nothing like this story as been such a race to the bottom for headlines for a long time.

I will note that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/10/todays-genital-warts-came-from-trysts-between-neanderthals-and-early-humans/">Annalee Newitz has a much better version of the story</a> with this winning quote:

<blockquote>[A]lways practice safer sex, even if you're getting down with a Denisovan.</blockquote>

There is, by the way, the interesting question of whether Neandertal immune variants might influence susceptibility to the strain in question, which has made little inroad into sub-Saharan Africa.
