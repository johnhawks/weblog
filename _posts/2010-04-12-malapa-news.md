A story about Malapa in the <i>Times</i> of South Africa gives just a few more details about the discovery of the infant remains near the two reported skeletons: <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article397316.ece/Baby-hominid-found-at-Cradle">"Baby hominid found at Cradle"</a>

Meanwhile, there's also this: 

<blockquote>Berger took the juvenile's fossils to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in France, in February, to test them using highly sophisticated equipment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At ESRF - an international research institute with cutting-edge technology - a fine X-ray beam, less than half the width of a strand of human hair, was used to scan the skull over four days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Berger said French scientist, Dr Paul Tafforeau, based at the ESRF, suspected that the juvenile's brain was still intact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He said the scan created a permanent record of the skull, adding: ''If something ... should happen to that skull, there's an electronic record of it at the highest resolution that human kind can produce right now."</blockquote>
