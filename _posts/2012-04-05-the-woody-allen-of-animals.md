I've been offline for the past several days on a family vacation. So I get back and what do I find in my feed reader? 

<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/04/giant-pandas-fail-to-mate">Giant pandas fail to mate</a></strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>The unsuccessful end to one of the briefest but most eagerly hyped trysts in conservation history was announced with a short statement from Edinburgh zoo: their giant pandas had failed to mate. The press release headline said simply: close but no cigar.</blockquote>

Nice to know the world never changes...
