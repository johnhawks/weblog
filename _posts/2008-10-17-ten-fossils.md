MSNBC is featuring <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27225171/?pg=1#Tech_WeirdScience_TenFossils">a tour of "ten fossils that evolved the tale of our origins."</a> You may find it interesting which ten they chose, and in any event it raises a question: which ten fossils <i>really are</i> the most important, from a scientific perspective?
