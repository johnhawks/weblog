<p>
I haven't been checking my stats much lately, aside from making sure things are running, but I was looking at the numbers today and noticed some amazing upticks. 
</p>

<p>
October was my best month so far with over 93,000 visits. And the last few months have put me on a pace to surpass a million visits this year -- the total for 2006 is already at 828,000. 
</p>

<p>
So keep on coming by -- I guarantee there will be some very interesting stuff in the next two months.
