So imagine you are digging out a pottery bowl from a 4000-year-old site, you turn it over, and out pops a bowl-shaped cast of dirt with <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9671263/"><i>noodles in the bottom!</i></a>

<blockquote>LONDON - Italians are known for them and theories suggest they may have originated in the Middle East but scientists said on Wednesday the world's oldest known noodles, dating back 4,000 years, were made in China.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Unlike modern Chinese noodles or Italian pasta that are made mostly of wheat, the 4,000-year-old variety consisted of millet which is indigenous to China.</blockquote>

<p>
That's some cool archaeology.
