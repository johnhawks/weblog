<em>Smithsonian</em> is running a retrospective on the career of Carl Sagan, by writer Joel Achenbach (<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-carl-sagan-truly-irreplaceable-180949818/#ixzz2uAtdpCxs ">"Why Carl Sagan is truly irreplaceable"</a>). The occasion is the upcoming premiere of the remake of <em>Cosmos</em>, the 1970's documentary series that made Sagan a household name. 

<blockquote>He led a feverish existence, with multiple careers tumbling over one another, as if he knew he wouldn’t live to an old age. Among other things, he served as an astronomy professor at Cornell, wrote more than a dozen books, worked on NASA robotic missions, edited the scientific journal Icarus and somehow found time to park himself, repeatedly, arguably compulsively, in front of TV cameras. He was the house astronomer, basically, on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show.” Then, in an astonishing burst of energy in his mid-40s, he co-created and hosted a 13-part PBS television series, “Cosmos.” It aired in the fall of 1980 and ultimately reached hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Sagan was the most famous scientist in America—the face of science itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now “Cosmos” is back, thanks largely to Seth MacFarlane, creator of TV’s “Family Guy” and a space buff since he was a kid, and Ann Druyan, Sagan’s widow. They’re collaborating on a new version premiering on the Fox Network on Sunday March 9. MacFarlane believes that much of what is on television, even on fact-based channels purporting to discuss science, is “fluff.” He says, “That is a symptom of the bizarre fear of science that’s taken hold.”</blockquote>

I think MacFarlane has it right. Very little science programming on television is either daring or inspiring. 

It will be interesting to see how the new <em>Cosmos</em> does.
