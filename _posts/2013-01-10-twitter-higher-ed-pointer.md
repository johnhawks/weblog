Many professors and instructors are starting semesters in the next week or two, me among them. As I'm preparing materials for my spring course, I'll post a few things that I've found useful to shake things up in class. 

Many readers will remember my post from last year, <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/teaching/resources/twitter-best-practices-2012.html">"Best practices and tips for Twitter in the higher-ed classroom"</a>. It has been consistently one of my top posts since I wrote it last year, and I've gotten some Twitter traffic for it this month. I thought it would be worth a link in case anyone is thinking of adding Twitter interaction to a course and may not have seen it.
