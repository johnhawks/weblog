Penn Gillette, writing in 2002 about <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/03/coolstuff/penniphile/roadpennfederalvip.html">an experience with a TSA "pat-down":</a> 

<blockquote>Well, it's not really the right word, but freedom is kind of a hobby with me, and I have disposable income that I'll spend to find out how to get people more of it.</blockquote>
