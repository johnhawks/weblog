Steve Mount works through the math of "relative finder" predictions from 23andMe (and by extension, other personal genome tests): <a href="http://ongenetics.blogspot.com/2011/02/genetic-genealogy-and-single-segment.html">"Genetic genealogy and the single segment"</a>. 

He does a nice short explanation of a point that is counter-intuitive to many people. You don't actually share much DNA with your relatives by descent, and because chromosomes are inherited in chunks, you quickly (within 6 generations) get to a point where you're not likely to have any DNA in common at all. Yet...you do have to have DNA from <i>somebody</i>, which means that if you do share DNA, you'll probably share a big chunk of it.
