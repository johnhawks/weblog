Today, <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/climate-change/2011/02/22/kerry-people-who-question-global-warming-are-neanderthals">it was Senator John Kerry</a>:

<blockquote>And in what might have might been the most bizarre exchange of the two-hour gathering, Kerry apologized to one woman who claimed he had called her a Neanderthal for not believing in global warming.</blockquote>

Hmmm.... I think we can forgive the Neandertals for being skeptical about global warming.
