My headline being an <i>homage</i> to the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/panda_legless_help_2007.html">legless panda story</a> earlier this month, I note the continued interest in panda dung recycling, which has now combined with the Beijing Olympics to create <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/30/AR2007073000314.html">the ultimate in <i>Shi Shi couture</i></a>:

<blockquote>BEIJING -- Nothing says "I love you" like a photo frame made from panda poop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Base has come up with a dung-for-profit scheme that turns droppings from the endangered species into odor-free souvenirs ranging from bookmarks to Olympic-themed statues of the animals, state media and base officials said Monday.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Pandas expand habitat areas in China</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Xinhua News Agency said forestry researchers have identified panda droppings in areas beyond known habitats bordering northwestern Gansu province and southwestern Sichuan province.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This indicates an expansion of the giant panda's habitat - and probably of its population, too," Huang Huali, vice director of the Baishuijiang Nature Reserve Administration, was quoted as saying.</blockquote>

<p>
Hmmm...I wonder if they checked to see if those droppings were in the form of, say, picture frames? Surely not...
