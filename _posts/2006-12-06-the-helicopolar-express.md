Outside my usual topics, but <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16065818/">this is too weird</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>FORT WORTH - Two British-based pilots set off into a blue Texas sky Tuesday on their second attempt to fly around the world via the North and South poles in a helicopter, one of the last great unaccomplished feats of aviation.</blockquote>

<p>
At what point do "great unaccomplished feats of aviation" become <i>trivial</i> unaccomplished feats of aviation? 
</p>

<blockquote>One of the longest stretches of the flight -- and one of the most perilous -- will be more than 500 miles over open water between the tip of South America and Antarctica.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After reaching the South Pole, the pair will double-back along the same Antarctic route but will fly over new territory in South America.</blockquote>

<p>
That's not <I>around</i> the world! That's <i>down</i> the world and back up again. These people crashed once trying, so it's unquestionably a challenge, but hmmm...
