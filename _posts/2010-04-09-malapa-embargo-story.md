Ivan Oransky writes <a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com">"Embargo Watch"</a>, which reports on issues related to journal embargoes and science reporting. His story about the Malapa embargo "break" last weekend is fascinating: <a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/now-it-can-be-told-my-take-on-the-science-hominid-missing-link-study-embargo/">"Now it can be told: My take on the Science hominin 'missing link' study embargo."</a>

It's an interesting look inside the world of science journalism, and the comments include replies from the press office at <i>Science</i> and some of the journalists involved in breaking the story. By their account, the initial stories this weekend were a result of old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, finding scientists outside the research team willing to comment on what they knew. In this way, the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> could run with the story before <i>Science</i> had even released its press kit.
