I missed <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol318/issue5852/newsmakers.dtl">this</a> in <i>Science</i> last week: 
</p>

<blockquote>As Indonesia's "king of paleoanthropology," Teuku Jacob ruled over a vital collection of hominid fossils....On 17 October, at the age of 76, the professor emeritus and former rector of Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta died of liver problems.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jacob studied fossil hominids under famed paleontologist G. H. R. von Koenigswald, then found and was curator of many important specimens, particularly of Homo erectus. He was a key figure in the Indonesian independence movement, making nationalist radio broadcasts after World War II during the country's 4-year fight for independence from the Dutch.</blockquote>
