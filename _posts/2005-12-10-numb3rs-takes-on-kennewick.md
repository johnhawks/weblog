I actually like CBS's <i>Numb3rs</i> much more than <i>Bones</i>, but it usually doesn't have anything to do with anthropology. But <a href="http://www.tvrules.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=9457">this week's episode, "Bones of contention"</a> was great --- it was a total send-up of the Kennewick story. 
</p>

<p>
Archaeologists find 10,000-year-old skeleton in California; it has "European" features; there's a court battle with a tribe; the archaeologists are bent on showing that the tribe has no claim to their casino land; the tribe's chief (Graham Greene) steals the bones and kills one of the archaeologists. 
</p>

<p>
And besides that, they have bitter tribe members who are being thrown out for having insufficient blood quanta -- just like the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/race/black_indians_genetic_testing_2005.html">"Black Indians"</a>

<p>
You can see why I would find this cool -- it's like they wrote the whole episode from posts on my blog!
</p>

<p>
Now, <i>Numb3rs</i> is all about using math to help the FBI, so they had Charlie helpfully explaining radiocarbon decay curves and discriminant functions (they even mentioned <a href="http://web.dii.utk.edu/fordisc/">FORDISC</a>!). Of course, a math genius is a bit of overkill for that, so they have him do a completely irrelevant side issue finding possible ancient sites from water holes. This falls into the category of "How many cases can a math professor <i>really</i> help the FBI with, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
I have to say my favorite part was watching the "anthropologist" (the one played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0123632/">Kate Burton</a>) try to explain "race" to Don. I'll paraphrase: 
</p>

<blockquote>DON: So you can tell what race the skull is? </blockquote>

<blockquote>ANTHRO: It's not really about race. Race is a social construct. It's more about geography. We can tell from the features of the skull, like whether the nose is well-suited for a cold, arid climate, what part of the world it is from -- Africa, Asia, or Europe. </blockquote>

<blockquote>HAWKS (at home): <i>So you're saying it's about <b>race</b>!</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>DON: Oh, I see. </blockquote>

<p>
Later...
</p>

<blockquote>DON: It turns out the skull is European. </blockquote>

<blockquote>DAVID: So they can tell what race it is?</blockquote>

<blockquote>DON: It turns out it's not really about race -- that's more of a social construct. </blockquote>

<blockquote>DAVID: I guess I didn't get that memo. </blockquote>

<blockquote>HAWKS (at home): (laughter) </blockquote>
