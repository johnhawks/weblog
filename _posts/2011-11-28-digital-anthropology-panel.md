Daniel Lende reports on the AAA panel on <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuroanthropology/2011/11/28/digital-anthropology-projects-and-platforms/">Digital Anthropology: Projects and Platforms</a>. 

<blockquote>Golub also advocated for anthropology to embrace a home grown approach to our online projects. Rather than following a professionalization model  of chasing after something like Wiley-Blackwell and for-profit publishing backed up by money, law, and company clout  we should develop our tastier craft beer model. This home brew approach has greater potential to yield original voices, and will avoid the many compromises and limits that come with chasing after that professional platform dream. This advocacy for a do it ourselves approach is important, and was a major highlight of the overall session for me.</blockquote>

The panel brought together people working on many interesting projects, and Lende gives a nice description of each.
