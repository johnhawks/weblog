The aye-aye is possibly the world's strangest primate. The species is native to Madagascar, and falls into the family of all primates from that island, the lemurs. But the aye-aye is a very specialized lemur, with anatomical features and behaviors not found in other lemurs.

Aye-ayes hunt for insects, using their fingers to tap on branches and locate grubs and insects that have burrowed into the bark and wood. Their middle finger is slender and elongated, with a claw on the end. They use this to probe inside insect burrows and take them out. 

Like some other lemurs, aye-ayes are <strong>nocturnal</strong> creatures, active at night. They are highly endangered and survive only in two forest preserves. 

The skull and mandible of the aye-aye are very distinctive compared to most other primates, even other lemurs.
