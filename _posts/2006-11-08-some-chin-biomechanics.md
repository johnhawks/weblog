<p>
As an aside from the Neandertal theme, I ran across a paper from earlier this year by Ichim, Swain, an Kieser, where they apply a mechanical model to mandibles with and without chins: 
</p>

<blockquote>The development of the chin, a feature unique to humans, suggests a close functional linkage between jaw biomechanics and symphyseal architecture. The present study tests the hypothesis that the presence of a chin changes strain patterns in the loaded mandible. Using an anatomically correct 3-D model of a dentate mandible derived from a CT scan image, we analyzed strain patterns during incisal and molar biting. We then constructed a second mandible, without a chin, by 'defeaturing' the first model. Strain patterns of the second model were then compared and contrasted to the first. Our main finding was that chinned and non-chinned mandibles follow closely concordant patterns of strain distribution. The results suggest that the development of the human chin is unrelated to the demands placed on the mandible during function.</blockquote>

<p>
There's a long literature on chin biomechanics (notably, including Tim White's dissertation!), and if you're interested you probably already know it. (If you're interested and <i>don't</i> already know it, there's still hope for you!)
</p>

<p>
So I really have no comments; just a note to point this one out.
