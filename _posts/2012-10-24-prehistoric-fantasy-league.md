<blockquote>It would also depend on training. Theres no telling how a reanimated Neanderthal would attack or defend himself in a fight against a Homo sapiens.</blockquote>

No, I don't endorse the taxonomy. But this has me thinking: what if we tried to compile the ultimate Doc Savage team of hominins? You know, a fossil fantasy league. Five ancient individuals, to bring together the strengths of lost races. 

I suppose the problem with that idea is that many of the best fossils really don't preserve the charismatic parts. Like SK 12 - one of the most impressive specimens of <em>Australopithecus robustus</em>, but it's a mandible. How do you cast a mandible in an action movie?
