The Shortcuts Blog discusses British runner Mo Farah, his identical twin Hassan, the heritability of extreme performance: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/shortcuts/2012/aug/20/mo-farah-talent-run-in-family">"Could Mo Farah's talent have run in the family?"</a>. The twins were raised apart after age 8. 

<blockquote>But, he added, as kids "Mo and I were on a par as runners. Sometimes I would beat him, sometimes he would beat me. He has had the most technically advanced training and advice available in the world ... and I have had nothing. Who knows what I could have become? We could have been famous twin Olympic athletes."</blockquote>

I generally give my first Anthro 105 lecture on sport, and I think this is a great topic to spark discussion.
