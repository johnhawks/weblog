Finally, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26036245/">a panda story I can get on board with</a>: 

<blockquote><b>Pandas: Evolution's big fat (adorable) mistake?</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Their unlikely perseverance seems to argue against 'survival of the fittest'</b></blockquote>

Oh, well -- despite the encouraging headline, it's mainly an article about how the panda really isn't as maladapted as it may seem.
