Here's a sentiment for popular science from the Victorian Age, from the translation note on Ernst Haeckel's <em>The History of Creation</em>, which was supervised by E. Ray Lankester:

<blockquote>I have not attempted to escape a difficulty by ignoring the German names made use of by Professor Haeckel for classes, orders, and genera, but have adopted English equivalents. I do not submit these names as a maturely considered English nomenclature, they appear here simply as necessary parts of a close rendering of the German work. I do, however, hold that some such series of English terms is both possible and useful, and do not doubtin spite of the pretended hostility of the genius of our language, and the curious sentimental objection that English names are <em>unscientific</em>that we shall before long make use of plain English in speaking of the various groups of plants and animalsmuch to the gain of the larger public, and without detriment to the latinized nomenclature established for the purposes of the professional student.</blockquote>

Emphasis in original.
