Well, I watched <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/5505963/Creation-the-movie-world-exclusive-trailer.html">the new trailer for the upcoming Darwin movie, <i>Creation</i></a>. On the one hand, there's an awful lot of senseless (and anachronistic-sounding) stuff -- he's writing the "Most Explosive Book of All Time", he's going to "Kill God". Yada yada yada.

On the other hand, we get Darwin partially nude next to Jennifer Connelly. 

OK, well, maybe those are both on the same hand. But Paul Bettany does look amazingly like sideburn-era Darwin from some angles. (Not, as far as I know, the partially nude ones...)


(the movie <a href="http://creationthemovie.com/">has a website, too</a>)
