The <i>New York Times</i> has a story in its Fashion section: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html?_r=1">"Blogs Falling in an Empty Forest"</a>

<blockquote>Getting started is easy, since all it takes to maintain a blog is a little time and inspiration. So why do blogs have a higher failure rate than restaurants?</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to a 2008 survey by Technorati, which runs a search engine for blogs, only 7.4 million out of the 133 million blogs the company tracks had been updated in the past 120 days. That translates to 95 percent of blogs being essentially abandoned, left to lie fallow on the Web, where they become public remnants of a dream  or at least an ambition  unfulfilled.</blockquote>

Hey, it's not for everybody. It's a lot of work.
