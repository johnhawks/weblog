Ethiopia is undergoing an unexpected government transition, and Yohannes Gedamu in <em>The Conversation</em> gives some context: <a href="https://theconversation.com/premier-quitting-and-state-of-emergency-signal-urgent-need-for-reform-in-ethiopia-91966">"Premier quitting and state of emergency signal urgent need for reform in Ethiopia"</a>.

<blockquote>All eyes are now on the ruling coalition as it deals with the prime ministerâ€™s resignation and scrambles to fill his position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Things are changing quickly in Ethiopia and it is difficult to predict what the ruling coalition will do next. One thing is clear: rather than declaring a state of emergency the ruling regime should come to terms with the popular demand for democracy, the rule of law and political and economic fairness.</blockquote>
