I enjoyed the <em>Washington Post</em> account of the "annual fattest bear contest" in Katmai National Park: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/09/americas-fattest-bear-is-about-be-crowned/">"America’s fattest bear has now been crowned"</a>.

The science nugget that drives the outreach here is that grizzlies in Alaska lose a third of their body mass over their hibernation in the winter. They have to put on fat during the summer and early fall to survive, and the result is one of the largest cycles of annual weight gain and loss. The outcome is impressive (with photos at the article).

<blockquote>They were probably too busy on the small Brooks River, an upstream bottleneck for hundreds of thousands of the 62 million salmon that passed through Alaska’s Bristol Bay this year, LaValle said. There, the bears easily snatch the fish, then promptly massacre them for the fattiest parts — the skin, fat and brain — before nonchalantly discarding the flesh for which we humans might pay upward of $30 a pound.</blockquote>

<blockquote>LaValle compares this surgical approach to not filling up on bread at a restaurant — the fat is the good stuff, and there’s plenty more where it came from.</blockquote>

Lots to think about for students who are learning about optimal foraging.
