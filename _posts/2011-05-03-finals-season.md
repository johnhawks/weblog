This is the time of year when hapless students all over the world turn to my blog to answer their exam questions. 

Of course, they don't <i>know</i> they're looking for my blog. They just turn to Google, cut and paste their exam question, and let their computers do the walking. 

Google has always been a good friend of mine, and is really good about leaving a calling card when people use it to find me. So this time of year I get a lovely report listing exam questions from around the world. I thought I would share a few that have stumbled onto my doorstep this month. 

Every one of these is a real question referred by Google to my site. They aren't punctuationally correct, of course, because they were entered into a Google search box, and many are compacted in some way. But many of them are obviously cut-and-pasted from some exam or study guide. For example: 

<blockquote>2._explain the main point concerning exponential growth and whether it is good or bad. compare exponential growth to a logistic growth curve and explain how these might a-</blockquote>

What kind of instructor asks a question that starts that way? "Is exponential growth good or bad?" I say it's good for my savings account and bad for my mortgage!

<blockquote>african nariokotome boy homo ergaster and describe the cranial traits which arehomo erectus-like such as the crania from java and china.</blockquote>

I think the student here ought to tell her instructor that the Daka and OH 9 crania are much more relevant to the question.


<blockquote>after hundreds or even thousands of generations both alleles are still common in those of african ancestry. how would you explain this</blockquote>

I have a feeling this is a sickle-cell question, trolling for balancing selection. The missing first part would lay out the homozygote fitness. 


<blockquote>comment on why trinkhaus et al. believed the skeleton to be a mixture of human and neandertal characteristics and why tattersall argues against them. make sure to give information for each researcher's case not just one of them</blockquote>

That's such an interesting question, even if your professor couldn't spell Trinkaus right. But I haven't written about it. Sorry!


<blockquote>how do scientists use living animals to uncover mysteries about prehistoric animals</blockquote>

I think that's why Mary Leakey kept dalmatians. 


<blockquote>if we find a new fossil hominid and notice that there is a large diastema between the lower canine and incisors which of the following can we infer about that hominid's dentition</blockquote>

"Lack of honing" is not the answer...

<blockquote>you find a fossil primate. it's arms and legs are approximately equivalent in length. this primate most likely had the locomotor pattern of a</blockquote>

<i>Ardipithecus!</i>

<blockquote>in lecture i explain why some anthropologists believe ardipithecus was a biped. briefly describe the anatomical evidencefor bipedality inardipithecus.</blockquote>

Hmm..."arms and legs the same length" is not the right answer here...

<blockquote>describe the important aspects of the cranium teeth hand pelvis and foot of ardipithecus</blockquote>

That's comprehensive. 

Here's a puzzle: 

<blockquote>if 3rd cousins marry are their offspring 4th cousins</blockquote>

Well, among other things...

Speaking of dating advice, there is this: 


<blockquote>how long does it take a chimpanzee to have quickie</blockquote>

Perhaps we should redefine our terms for that one. 

<blockquote>how do the changes in the dentition the reduction in the size of canines and the evolution of bipedalism indicate changes in di-</blockquote>

Beeeeep! Sorry, we didn't get your message. 

<blockquote>which is strong evidence that similar traits in different evolutionary lineages are the result of homology and not homoplasy</blockquote>

Which <i>is</i> strong evidence? I wonder...

<blockquote>the term lithic as in the word paleolithic or as used in the phrase lithic tool or lithic industry refers to:</blockquote>

Stone, man, stone!

Here's a barrage of "what" questions:

<blockquote>what factors reveal the reduction and simplification of the human dentition</blockquote>

<blockquote>what fundamental questions of interpretation do the fossil hominids from dmanisi raise</blockquote>

<blockquote>what is buller's argument against massive modularity as is found in traditional evolutionary psychology</blockquote>

<blockquote>what is the key criterion of the recognition species concept</blockquote>

<blockquote>what morphological traits tell you that a primate was bipedal</blockquote>

<blockquote>what is so special about homo the upper paleolithic when does it first appear what characterizes it what does it tell us about early human cognitive abilities</blockquote>

<blockquote>what has been learned from the sequencing of the denisovans and neanderthals genomes</blockquote>


<blockquote>what is similar between clams and humans</blockquote>

Filter feeders.

<blockquote>what is hillary clinton's blood type</blockquote>

B negative? 

<blockquote>what has 138 eyes and enough cognitive power to create a life colony on mars</blockquote>

I do not remotely comprehend how that search led to me. 

<blockquote>what anatomical characteristics define modern as compared to premodern humans or non-human primates assume that you're analyzing an incomplete skeleton that may be early modern h. sapiens. which portions of the skeleton would be most in-</blockquote>


<blockquote>what does evidence from fossils archaeology and dna tell us about which one is more correct</blockquote>

Well, depends on the question. A good week for fossils on these questions: 

<blockquote>what did a robust australopithecine eat</blockquote>

<blockquote>what dentition tells about diet</blockquote>

But maybe not this one: 

<blockquote>who are the people that inhabited europe during the middle and late pleistocene</blockquote>

What a joyful question. I would love to answer this one! I could come up with a different answer for every day of the week. 

<blockquote>who first proposed out of africa hypothesis</blockquote>

This one is interesting, because my answer is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiner_Protsch">Reiner Protsch</a>. 


<blockquote>what is the most likely explanation for the extinction of the early small-brained hominins (gracile and robust) and the survival of the early homo genus</blockquote>

Teh stoopid.





<blockquote>what kind of genes are the _ majority of differences between humans and chimpanzees. give an example of how such a gene could work (it needn't be real).</blockquote>

What the heck? <i>"It needn't be real"?</i> This seems like a professor trolling for "regulatory genes", where the student is supposed to regurgitate the Mary-Claire King argument. <b>Don't do it!</b> 


Here's a return of the first exam, I think: 

<blockquote>7-_according to gould what is the range of years when the ape-hominid split (divergence) occurred what group of compounds did they base their hypothesis o-</blockquote>

What class is this? Why the heck would they be reading Gould on this? If you're this student, <b>drop now before it's too late. Your professor has no clue!</b>

<blockquote>why don't we see this same type of symbolic expression with earlier hominins such as homo erectus</blockquote>

Teh stoopid.



Lots of questions start with "compare". Such as: 


<blockquote>compare and contrast the organization of the y chromosome in humans and chimpanzees</blockquote>

That seems like a pretty advanced question, it would take me hours to make sure I had this one right. Maybe it's a qualifying exam? At least my post would have pointed them to the right research paper. 


<blockquote>compare the bones of forelimb and hindlimb</blockquote>

Uh...this seems pretty open-ended. All the bones of the forelimb are shorter than the bones of the hindlimb...

<blockquote>compare two different hypotheses that attempt to explain the origins of hominid bipedalism.</blockquote>

I'd pick the trenchcoat hypothesis. 

<blockquote>what evidence proves that a.afarensis exists (fossils)</blockquote>

Um, hmm. Is that self-answering, or is there something more here?



<blockquote>compare kenyanthropus and ardipithecus</blockquote>

That question clearly should be answered in the form of a haiku: 

<blockquote>Two fossils glued in<br />
Matrix of Google search for<br />
Tim White distortion</blockquote>



Finally, there are the questions that are tinged with sadness and desperation. I have to suspect this one was googled from the middle of somebody's lecture: 

<blockquote>here they will experience obisity boredom loss of purpose</blockquote>


Oh, my. But that's nothing compared to the problem here: 

<blockquote>does the student need to spend the next two weeks re-preparing protein or is there still hope for him to salvage this experiment and graduate bedfore the end f th-</blockquote>

Oh, my. You know, I think it's the "bedfore" that really tugs at my heart.

<blockquote>what can i do with a biological anthropology degree</blockquote>

Oh, my. Talk about twisting the knife. 



<blockquote>world most libidinous women</blockquote>

Er...well, maybe that one wasn't an <i>exam</i> question, exactly?
