Esther Ingliss-Arkell has an interesting short description of <a href="http://io9.com/what-happens-when-you-get-the-wrong-blood-type-1696686395#">"What Happens When You Get The Wrong Blood Type?"</a> on _io9_. 

<blockquote>The first sign of a transfusion gone wrong is "a feeling of impending doom." This is a legitimate medical symptom, and doctors who regularly work with blood transfusions are told to look for it. Other sign of a mismatched blood type is the usual immune system warning flags â€” flu-like fever, ache, and chill, as well as a burning sensation at the injection site.</blockquote>

I teach the ABO system as part of my usual human genetics lectures, and I've never read a great description of the range of transfusion reactions---I was really only aware of the most catastrophic type. So this can be an interesting piece for those teaching ABO as well as those who've just always wondered.
