UPDATE (2008/4/15): The presentation was withdrawn from the meetings. I'm told that the information in the abstract is accurate, and that the withdrawal doesn't concern the science...
</p>

<p>
And no, the room wouldn't have been nearly big enough...

Just flipping through the abstracts volume...this looks interesting:

<blockquote><b>New <i>Homo erectus</i> crania from Ethiopia</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>By the Early Pleistocene, members of the genus <i>Homo</i> were distributed throughout Africa and Asia, spreading into Europe by the Middle Pleistocene.  As expected from such a widely distributed and long-lived species, variation in anatomical details is marked. This variation has fueled debate about the number of Early Pleistocene <i>Homo</i> species that existed and their relationship with modern humans.  Here we report on two newly discovered hominid adult crania - one female and one male - dated to 1.5-1.7 My from the Busidima Formation, Gona Paleoanthropological Research Project area, Afar State, Ethiopia.  An additional <i>H. erectus</i> cranial fragment (&tilde;1.24My) is also reported.  These crania are near contemporaries of specimens from Kenya, Tanzania, Republic of Georgia, and Southeast Asia and are attributable to <i>Homo erectus.</i>  These fossils document a greater degree of brain size variation than previously known and allow a better accounting of the magnitude and character of cranial sexual dimorphism in size and shape. </blockquote>

New fossils, "greater degree of brain size variation," very cool. I hope they have a big enough room.
