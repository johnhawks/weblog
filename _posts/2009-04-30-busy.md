I'm busier than usual today, preparing for a talk tomorrow. If you're free at noon and in the Social Science Building, it's titled: 

<blockquote><b>Natural selection and the population history of Gujarat, India</b></blockquote>

I'm hardly an expert in South Asia, but I have some interesting results. Meanwhile, some very provocative things have crossed my desk this week. Thanks to several readers who have passed things along, and I'll be busily posting this weekend.
