<i>Discover</i> has put an article online that they ran in the November issue, which features Steven Churchill's research (<a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/nov/30-did-we-mate-with-neanderthals-or-murder-them">"Did we mate with Neanderthals, or did we murder them"</a>). It's a good "present status" article about possible human-Neandertal interactions, pretty much as summarized in the headline. It would be a good link for intro classes. 

For more information about almost every one of the topics in the article, you could do worse than searching my archives:
