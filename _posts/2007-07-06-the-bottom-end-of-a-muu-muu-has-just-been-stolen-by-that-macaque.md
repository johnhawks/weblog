I'm watching mid-day kid-friendly animal programming, when I realize a central fact of television reality: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Corwin">Jeff Corwin</a> is a freak. Not just any kind of freak. A climbing-up-on-Indian-rooftops-with-urban-monkeys kind of freak. A "Hey lady, that monkey just stole your jogging shorts!" kind of freak. 
</p>

<p>
LUCY: "I don't want this kind of show. I don't want it! I don't want it! I don't want this kind! I don't want this kind!"
</p>

<p>
DADDY: "Really, you don't want this show?" 
</p>

<p>
LUCY: "I want a cartoon."
</p>

<p>
DADDY: "Believe me, that's what you're watching."
