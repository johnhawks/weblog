The University today announced that I have won a big research award, the H. I. Romnes Fellowship <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/20464">"Romnes Fellowships awarded to 11 recently tenured faculty"</a>. It is a great honor! 

I'm excited that the research money will allow me to carry out some important research travel and project planning. I can't wait to share the projects as they develop!
