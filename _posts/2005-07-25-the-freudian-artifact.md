Why is it that the BBC always picks up stories like <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm">this one</a>? (via <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/palanthsci/message/24810">palanthsci</a>)
</p>

<blockquote>The 20cm-long, 3cm-wide stone object, which is dated to be about 28,000 years old, was buried in the famous Hohle Fels Cave near Ulm in the Swabian Jura.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The prehistoric "tool" was reassembled from 14 fragments of siltstone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Its life size suggests it may well have been used as a sex aid by its Ice Age makers, scientists report.</blockquote>

<p>
Did you have to go there, BBC? "Tool"? 
</p>

<p>
Go to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm">the story</a>. See the picture. Cringe at quotes like this one from Nick Conard: 
</p>

<blockquote>"In addition to being a symbolic representation of male genitalia, it was also at times used for knapping flints"</blockquote>

<p>
And please try to consider what it says about Neandertals that they never made one.

<p>
It's not <a href="http://tbs.com/stories/story/0,,15506,00.html">"The Rabbit"</a>, but I suppose they had to make do...
