On October 2, I will be participating in a public symposium at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, titled <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/event/2015-past-present-future-dna-symposium">"The Past, Present, and Future of DNA"</a>. From the website: 

<blockquote>The one-day science symposium will focus on the explosion of knowledge about past and present DNA, and will include discussions about possible directions and applications for future research. The event will include experts in ancient DNA, de-extinction, human origins, population genetics, forensic science, ethics, business, future synthetic life, and the personal genome.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>This event is free and open to the public. </blockquote>

I'll be part of a session talking about the science of ancient DNA, moderated by George Church, and with Beth Shapiro and Spencer Wells as the other presenters. I'm looking forward to it, and I think the entire event will be a really timely and provocative look at where DNA technology and society are going. If you are in the Boston area and want to attend, the event is free but does require pre-registration, so check it out!
