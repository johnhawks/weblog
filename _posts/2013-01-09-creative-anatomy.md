Mike Taylor from Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week shows how anatomists get creative with their measurement instruments: <a href="http://svpow.com/2013/01/10/tutorial-20-how-to-measure-necks-using-duplo/">"How to measure necks using Duplo"</a>:

<blockquote>I find the best way to get the neck exactly abutting the left (red) wall is to start with the neck in its natural position, with the anterior and posterior ends curving towards you, then sort of unroll it against the back wall, and finally push the posterior end into place with your little finger (see below). There is a satisfying moment of the back end popping into place  almost a click  and the neck slides along a little to right as necessary to accommodate the added length.</blockquote>
