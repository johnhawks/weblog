I'm watching the Discovery Channel's new "Planet Earth" miniseries -- though not in primetime but in rebroadcast. The series seem like a way to sell people HD televisions, and I have to say they're gorgeous. In the second episode there is a long segment showing geladas in highland Ethiopia, moving in groups of several hundred.

<p>
The series includes many long shots from the air, which allows them to show the movement of herds (or troops) from a longer perspective that shows their dynamics. In the first episode, this was used to great effect showing the hunting tactics of wolves and Cape dogs.

Also in the first, there was footage of baboons wading bipedally into the Okavango Delta.
