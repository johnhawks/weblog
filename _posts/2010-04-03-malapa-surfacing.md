Richard Gray of <i>The Telegraph</i> has a story about the upcoming Malapa hominin announcement: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/evolution/7550033/Missing-link-between-man-and-apes-found.html">"Missing link between man and apes found"</a>

<blockquote>Palaeontologists and human evolutionary experts behind the discovery have remained silent about the exact details of what they have uncovered, but the scientific community is already abuzz with anticipation of the announcement of the find when it is made on Thursday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The skeleton was found by Professor Lee Berger, from the University of the Witwatersrand, while exploring cave systems in the Sterkfontein region of South Africa, near Johannesburg, an area known as "the Cradle of Humanity".</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>


<blockquote>It is thought that the new fossil to be unveiled this week will be identified as a new species that fits somewhere between Australopithicus [sic] and Homo habilis.</blockquote>

The story is otherwise devoid of information content, including the unrevealing comments by P. V. Tobias. 

This would seem to be an embargo break, so we'll have to see what further information may come to light in the next few hours. I have heard that the description will be published in <i>Science</i> (that's the Thursday embargo noted here). 

UPDATE (2010-04-03): The <i>Times</i> enters with <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/biology_evolution/article7087050.ece">an even less informative story</a>.
