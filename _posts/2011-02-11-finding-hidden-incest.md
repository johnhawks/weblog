Another unexpected result of gene chips: Identifying hidden incest in the course of routine tests for developmental disabilities:

<blockquote>Houston doctors are reporting that the newest generation of DNA testing, now in wide use, is revealing many previously missed incest cases that raise difficult legal and ethical questions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Children born to first-degree relatives have a developmental disability about half the time, said Beaudet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Baylor began using the new test about six months ago. During that time, Beaudet said, the lab has seen evidence of incest fewer than 10 times.</blockquote>

"Half the time" seems high to me, but would explain the high positive rate here.
