Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/bela_lugosi_apeman_2009.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="Bela Lugosi as the Apeman" />
</div>

Can you believe that Bela Lugosi was the original Apeman? Not <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1875">Tarzan the "ape man"</a>, but Apeman. Although with the beard they gave him, I couldn't stop thinking he was the Goat-man. I'm not sure what's in the syringe, there, but I'm sure it's not good.
