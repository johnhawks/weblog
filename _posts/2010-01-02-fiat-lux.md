From <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/sumerians_look_on_in_confusion_as"><i>The Onion</i></a>: 

<blockquote><b>Sumerians Look On In Confusion As God Creates World</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I do not understand," reads an ancient line of pictographs depicting the sun, the moon, water, and a Sumerian who appears to be scratching his head. "A booming voice is saying, 'Let there be light,' but there is already light. It is saying, 'Let the earth bring forth grass,' but I am already standing on grass."</blockquote>

Maybe someone can get the Creation Museum interested? 

<blockquote>Moreover, the Sumerians were taken aback by the creation of the same animals and herb-yielding seeds that they had been domesticating and cultivating for hundreds of generations.</blockquote>

Uhh...probably not...
