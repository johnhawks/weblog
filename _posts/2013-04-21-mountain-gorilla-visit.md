Chimpanzee researcher Maureen McCarthy describes a visit to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda, to see the mountain gorillas: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/2013/04/21/chimps-in-uganda-ugandas-other-great-apes/">"Uganda's other great apes"</a>.

<blockquote> Like chimpanzees, gorillas are very closely related to humans and can easily catch the illnesses we carry. Just one outbreak of a respiratory infection could be enough to wipe out an entire gorilla group, or worse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Though this may seem like a bleak state of affairs, mountain gorillas are actually heralded as a conservation success story. Their numbers have increased significantly in recent decades as a result of conservation efforts linked to ecotourism. Tourists flock to Uganda each year to visit these famous residents. Now it was our turn.</blockquote>

McCarthy's earlier posts, sort of a field journal about her work with wild chimpanzees in Uganda, are worth exploring.
