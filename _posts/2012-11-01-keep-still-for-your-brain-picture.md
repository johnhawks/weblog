Ben Deen and Kevin Pelphrey in <em>Nature</em>: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7422_supp/full/491S20a.html">"Perspective: Brain scans need a rethink" </a>.

<blockquote>Recent studies, however, have found that when a person moves their head while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) -- a method that maps how different neuroanatomical structures of the brain interact in real time, its functional connectivity -- it looks like the neural activity observed in autism. That's a sobering discovery: it means that a major source of evidence for a leading hypothesis on autism, and one that several research teams have pursued for years, may arise from an artifact.</blockquote>

Remember the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/dead-fish-scanning-2009.html">"dead salmon" study</a>, in which inert tissue placed in the scanner produced results? The statistical methods underlying comparisons of fMRI between cases and controls rely on averaging a multidimensional space across many individuals. A bias doesn't have to be very large to lead to a significant difference between groups:

<blockquote>[A]s one of the new studies showed, even a difference as small as 0.004 millimetre in average head motion across groups of patients can lead to significant differences in correlation strengths.</blockquote>

That's four <em>microns!</em> That is, of course, an average across a large sample, each child has his or her own motion. Imagine trying to get them to average out so that the average motto is precisely equal across a few dozen individuals. And then, as the article discusses ways that might correct for linear biases, you are still left with the possibility that head motion has a nonlinear effect on result, so that the bias survives your attempt to correct for it. 

How remarkable, the very complex approaches necessary to deal with a relatively simple phenomenon.
