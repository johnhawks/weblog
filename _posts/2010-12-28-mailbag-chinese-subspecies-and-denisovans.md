Re: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/denisova-nuclear-genome-reich-2010.html">Denisova</a>: 

<blockquote>Thank you for the very rapid FAQ on this fascinating new article!  As you say, 
the findings should not be unexpected.  Even the contribution from archaics to 
present-day Melanesians was foretold by the New Mexico group.  Maybe this will 
put some sanity into those recurring "Modern humans are from China not Africa" 
stories.  Pleistocene Homo sapiens in Asia just gets no respect!  This seems to 
show a population of Chinese Neanderthals replacing H. erectus and later being 
replaced by OOA, but neither is quite 100%.
 
Just thinking If present-day populations, Neanderthals, and Denisovans make a 
near-trichotomy of SUBSPECIES, perhaps Homo sapiens mapaensis Kurth 1965 or Homo 
sapiens daliensis Wu Xinzhi 1981 will be found to have priority</blockquote>

Yes, I suspect those names may be available, depending on the timing of these population divergences. The Chinese record has several shoes left to drop.
