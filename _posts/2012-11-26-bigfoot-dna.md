A <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2012/11/prweb10166775.htm">press release claims the recovery of Sasquatch DNA</a>:

<blockquote>Sasquatch nuclear DNA is incredibly novel and not at all what we had expected. While it has human nuclear DNA within its genome, there are also distinctly non-human, non-archaic hominin, and non-ape sequences. We describe it as a mosaic of human and novel non-human sequence. Further study is needed and is ongoing to better characterize and understand Sasquatch nuclear DNA.</blockquote>

This has been developing for a while. Until I see the data, I am withholding judgment.

One benefit of the world of genetics as opposed to traditional anthropology: The original sequence data must be made available to the public. No data, no discovery.
