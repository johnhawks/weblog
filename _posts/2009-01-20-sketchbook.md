Today's sketchbook page: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/sk_63_sk_3978_sketchbook.jpg" width="300" height="457" alt="Swartkrans juvenile mandibles" />
</div>

Two juvenile mandibles from Swartkrans. The two are not to scale -- the larger tooth in the lower mandible is a dm<sub>2</sub>; that's the medium (central) tooth in the top mandible.
