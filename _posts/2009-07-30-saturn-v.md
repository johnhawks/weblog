The <I>LA Times</i> had <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-apollo19-2009jul19,0,2826358,full.story">a very nice article last week</a> with reminiscences of engineers who built the Saturn V rocket: 

<blockquote>A key problem was the start-up. "They had a design for the starting sequence," Biggs said in an interview. "I did the analysis and told them it was no good. The rocket would probably blow up."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Biggs' solution was to slow down the launch sequence. That gave the Saturn V its characteristic feline look, as it seemed to crouch and gather itself for five seconds after ignition before lifting off the launch pad.</blockquote>

Imagine that -- a "feline look" for a 40-story rocket.
