Jack Hitt writing in the <em>NY TImes</em> writes some thoughts on the way that online post-publication commentary and review are changing the authority of scientific statements: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/opinion/sunday/science-and-truth-were-all-in-it-together.html">"Science and Truth - We're All In It Together"</a>. He takes as his theme the 2005 "sighting" of the ivory-headed woodpecker. Every piece of evidence that appeared to support this sighting was later debunked by serious naturalists and amateur birders, working in a loose network centered on a blog. Early in the public exposure of the story, more prominent scientists given fuller information than the public had privately expressed doubts, but held their tongues. 

<blockquote>Take the case of the ivory-bill. The article in Science has never been retracted. Cornell still stands by its video. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service acted as though the ivory-bill existed, and, in 2008, it asked for $27 million to support recovery efforts. Heres the thing: The ivory-billed woodpecker is the Schrdingers cat of contemporary media  dead to those whove looked inside Tom Nelsons blog but alive to the professionals who cant bear to.</blockquote>
