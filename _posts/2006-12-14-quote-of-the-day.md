<i>New York Times</i> corrections column, on July 17, 1969 (a day after the Apollo 11 launch), referring to a 1920 column that claimed Robert Goddard's rockets could not possibly operate in space:
</p>

<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.</blockquote>

(from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goddard_(scientist)">Wikipedia</a>)
</p>

<p>
Also, from the original 1920 unsigned editorial, this nugget of wisdom: 
</p>

<blockquote>To claim that it would be [able to operate in a vacuum] is to deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only <i>Dr. Einstein</i> and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.</blockquote>
