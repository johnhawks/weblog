This came across my feed this morning: <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2018/jul/30/museum-man-san-diegos-balboa-park-asks-publics-hel/">"San Diego Museum of Man In Balboa Park Wants Your Help Deciding New Name"</a>.

It's a good idea---the name is confusing:

<blockquote>But one tourist from Europe said he thought the museum was literally just about males.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When I was there I thought itâ€™s only for men," Intan Devreies said. "In the Dutch language, "man" means man not humankind."</blockquote>

<blockquote>A spokeswoman for the Museum of Man said a new name will not be unveiled until 2020.</blockquote>

The thing is, in the twenty-first century, "Museum of Man" sounds like somebody's idea of a hip, ironic name for a museum actually devoted to men.
