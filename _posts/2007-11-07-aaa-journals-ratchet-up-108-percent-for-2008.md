I have this from my university library today: 
</p>

<blockquote>As you all know, the AAA recently decided to outsource its publishing activities to Wiley-Blackwell. We're not sure how this will affect personal subscriptions, but our institutional rate had skyrocketed from $232 p.a. for <i>American Anthropologist</i> to $432, and from $138 for <i>American Ethnologist</i> to $338. To put it another way, the two subscriptions combined will now cost us 108% more in 2008 than in 2007.</blockquote>

<p>
The outcome of this will be that the university will go all-electronic and cut the print version, which as they point out will <i>still</i> be 3 times higher than the print edition used to be. 
</p>

<p>
I have to wonder how relevant these journals will be when libraries begin dropping the sectional journals to make up the cost of the flagships. And how relevant <i>they</i> will be as more people publish their work in open access outlets. It seems pretty clear that if you want your work to be read outside of Research I universities, the AnthroSource journals are not a viable option. 
</p>

<p>
UPDATE (2007/11/07): May I add, that while <a href="http://alexa.com/">Alexa</a> shows that AnthroSource averages around twice or three times my traffic, little <i>johnhawks.net</i> has beaten AnthroSource over several short periods in the last three months? 
</p>

<p>
Now, serving PDF's is another level of bit-moving from what I do, but since I'm, well, <i>free</i> and all, I can say with some authority that it can be done a whole lot cheaper than AnthroSource is doing it. 
</p>

<p>
UPDATE (2007/11/07): In fact -- you can tell I'm getting incensed -- <i>American Anthropologist</i> is <i>quarterly!</i> They run around 55 articles and reviews a year. So the institution is expected to pay over $8 per article. 
</p>

<p>
The Public Library of Science publishes articles in <i>PLoS One</i> for a waivable author fee of $1250. The sum total of that fee for 55 articles would be around $70,000 -- a price for which Wiley-Blackwell is going to supply <i>American Anthropologist</i> to around 160 institutions. That's not counting the till of individual subscriptions (part of AAA membership fees) -- which they've rolled into the total, but used to be around a $40 add-on for sections that required the journal. 
</p>

<p>
Is it really possible that the 11,000 members of the AAA could subsidize worldwide free access to an all-electronic <i>American Anthropologist</i> entirely for less than $10 a head?
