<p>
The AP <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9492037/">is reporting</a> on the discovery of a double newborn burial near Krems, Austria. The remains are estimated at 27,000 years old, and were buried directly side-by-side along with a string of 31 beads and mammoth bones.

<p>
Not much detail in the story, although there is this: 
</p>

<blockquote>Archaeologists are combing the area to see if the infants' mother is nearby, as giving birth to twins in that era would have been extremely difficult and potentially fatal.</blockquote>

<p>
Not to mention for the babies!
