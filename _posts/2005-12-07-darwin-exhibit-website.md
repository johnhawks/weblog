The American Museum of Natural History has set up <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/">a Darwin website</a> to accompany their Darwin exhibit. It's pretty good -- not too heavy on detail, and nicely put together. The teaching resources look very useful for K-12 teachers, and there are links to other locations.

So it might be worth checking out.
