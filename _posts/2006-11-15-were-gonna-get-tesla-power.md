This <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6129460.stm">article</a> was so cool I had to point it out: 
</p>

<blockquote>US researchers have outlined a relatively simple system that could deliver power to devices such as laptop computers or MP3 players without wires.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The team from MIT is not the first group to suggest wire-less energy transfer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nineteenth-century physicist and engineer Nikola Tesla experimented with long-range wire-less energy transfer, but his most ambitious attempt - the 29m high aerial known as Wardenclyffe Tower, in New York - failed when he ran out of money.</blockquote>

<p>
It's not for broadcasting power around the world -- it's for charging up devices and, potentially, nanotech. Which is logical but ironic: on the macro scale wires are cheap, but on the micro scale they are bulky and expensive!
