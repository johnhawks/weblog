In the supplement of Kristian Carlson and colleagues' paper on the MH1 endocast <bib>Carlson:Malapa:2011</bib>, there's a nice comparison of the medical CT versus synchotron images. My blog sizing can't do it justice, and to be honest, the online PDF in <i>Science</i> doesn't either, but you get the idea: 

<div class="middle-picture">

<p class="caption">Figure S10 from Carlson et al. 2011, detail. Original caption: Comparison of the same slice of the MH 1 cranium obtained with medical CT (left) and synchrotron scanning at the ESRF (right). Voxel sizes are approximately 450 ?m and 45.71 ?m, respectively.</p>

You know, someday we'll all have these data for the entire fossil record, and students won't think a thing of it.
