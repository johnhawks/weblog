Earlier this year, I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/1883">pointed to a <i>Washington Post</i> profile of Grover Krantz</a>. Now the <i>Post</i> follows up with the news that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/10/AR2009041003357.html?referrer=emailarticle">Grover's skeleton is on exhibit.</a> And his big dog, too: 

<blockquote>The skeletons of Krantz and his beloved Irish wolfhound, Clyde, make up the striking display that comes at the end of the museum's current forensic anthropology exhibit, "Written in Bone."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two are depicted mimicking an old photograph, with the skeleton of Clyde up on his hind legs and Krantz cradling the dog's forelegs in his arms.</blockquote>

There's a short slideshow with the article. And an ending that brought a tear: 

<blockquote>"That is a big person," said a little girl. "Looks like he's smiling.</blockquote>
