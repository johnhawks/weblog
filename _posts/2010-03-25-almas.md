I'm told by a reader that the Altai cryptid is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almas_%28cryptozoology%29">Almas</a>, not the Yeti. 

So there you have it. Maybe this will lead to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312963009?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312963009">a John Darnton sequel?</a>
