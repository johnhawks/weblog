I don't have a picture, but this week Prince Valiant seems to have encountered a band of Neandertals. At least, they look just like Neandertals that Charles Knight might have painted. Except they're wearing swamp-walking snow shoes and helping drive away a giant octopus with their tiny arrows. 

We'll find out more next week...

UPDATE (2008-10-10): A reader very kindly sent <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/comics/?feature_id=Prince_Valiant&feature_date=2008-10-05">a link</a> to the online strip (P.S. If you're that reader, my e-mails to you are bouncing). Here are the Neandertals:
