The <a href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> is starting a video service. They're calling it <a href="http://www.scivee.tv/">SciVee</a>, and it looks like a very cool concept. The idea is that if you publish a scientific paper, you would upload a short video explaining the paper -- sort of like a conference presentation version of the research. 
</p>

<p>
Why would you want to do this? Well, why does anybody give conference presentations? I mean aside from getting their university to pay for their room.... You want your work to be more visible, easier for other people to understand and use, and to cite: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>What is a "SciVee"?</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>A SciVee is what we call the combination of a scientific publication and video or audio presentation.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>You can make a video of yourself speaking about a paper you have published, or even just record your voice, and then (using the SciVee website) synchronize your presentation with the display of text and figures from your paper. It is kind of like giving a talk at a conference where the audience can see you and also see your visual aids - except the SciVee fits on a computer screen and the audience can view it anytime, anyplace (as long as they have an internet connection).</blockquote>

<blockquote>We've found that SciVees that are 10 minutes or less and cover the major highlights of the paper are pretty effective and make keeping up with the literature a lot more enjoyable. We think SciVees will really help spread the word about your work so give it a try - it is probably a lot easier and more fun than you might be thinking.</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, there's nothing stopping anyone from doing this on their own -- and since at the moment SciVee is limited to open access journals, maybe somebody will roll their own version. It's similar to what some journals have been doing with their weekly podcasts, but I like the more democratic aspect here. And it saves you from having to find your own bandwidth, or using (gasp!) YouTube.
