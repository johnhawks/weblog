<blockquote>Having already made the transition from indie hipster in "Swingers," which he wrote, co-produced and starred in, to family entertainer with "Elf," which he directed, Jon Favreau is next sequeing [sic] into toonland.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sony Pictures Animation said Monday that Favreau will write and produce the CG-animated feature "Neanderthals," based on his original story. Further details about the plot line, the company said, "are being kept in a cave under a large boulder protected by a mastodon."</blockquote>
