Wilfred Le Gros Clark, on controversy in human origins:

<blockquote>Every discovery of a fossil relic which appears to throw light on connecting links in man's ancestry always has, and always will, arouse controversy, and it is right that this should be so, for it is very true that the sparks of controversy often illuminate the way to truth.</blockquote>

from his lecture, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2844248">"Bones of Contention"</a>, 1958.
