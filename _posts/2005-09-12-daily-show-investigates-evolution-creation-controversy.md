All week long, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">the <i>Daily Show</i> with Jon Stewart</a> is devoting its comedy to "Evolution Schmevolution". 
</p>

<p>
Tonight it's a visit to Dayton, Tennessee, the site of the Scopes Trial. There was also an interview with Chris Mooney, author of <i>The Republican War on Science</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow they will be at the Bronx Zoo, and will interview Kurt Vonnegut (not at the same time, I assume). 
</p>

<p>
So far, the evolution part is relatively minor, driving the monologue and the on-location segment. The on-location stuff I always find to be mean-spirited, myself. But the monologue made me laugh -- especially the maladapted fire-breathing godzilla giraffe.
