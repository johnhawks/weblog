The <em>New York Times</em> has a powerful story about the genetics of early onset Alzheimer's disease, by Gina Kolata: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/magazine/an-alzheimers-gene-one-familys-saga.html">"An Alzheimer's gene: one family's saga"</a>. 

<blockquote> Gary was pretty sure it was his family whose gene had been found.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He got a copy of <em>Science</em> and turned to the article, which included a family tree with members who had the gene represented by black diamonds. Those who did not have the gene were represented by white diamonds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was scary even to look. Gary knew every person in that diagram, and he knew he was there too. Would he be a black diamond or a white one?</blockquote>

The story focuses on one very large family in which onset at age 50 was clearly caused by a Mendelian dominant. But in addition to this, it gives a perspective on how the science works, where unraveling rare Mendelian causes for the disorder helps identify the pathways by which more common -- and more complex -- multigenic cases of the disorder may work.
