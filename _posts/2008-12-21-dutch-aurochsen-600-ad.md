Not a big story, but <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081212081544.htm">nice reminder</a> that some extinct megafauna were still with us in historic times: 

<blockquote>Archaeological researchers at the University of Groningen have discovered that the aurochs, the predecessor of our present-day cow, lived in the Netherlands for longer than originally assumed. Remains of bones recently retrieved from a horn core found in Holwerd (Friesland, Netherlands), show that the aurochs became extinct in around AD 600 and not in the fourth century.</blockquote>

Locally extinct, that is, since they survived longer to the east:

<blockquote>The last aurochs died in Poland in 1627.</blockquote>

So close.
