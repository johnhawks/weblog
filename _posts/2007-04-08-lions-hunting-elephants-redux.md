Wow, "Planet Earth" tonight had nightime footage of lions taking down an elephant. It was one of those lone young males, and it had thirty lions running it down, with multiple lions jumping up on its back. I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/life_history/risk/lion_elephant_predation_2006.html">wrote about this</a> last year; it's fascinating to see it in action.

They didn't catch the final takedown on film, but they had the gratuitous hungry lions eating the elephant shot.

It's the "Great Plains" episode; which actually had very little about the real Great Plains -- that is, the part of the American West where I'm from.
