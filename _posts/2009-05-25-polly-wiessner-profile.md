The <i>New York Times'</i> Claudia Dreifus <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/science/26conv.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss">interviews anthropologist Polly Wiessner</a>, known for her pathbreaking work on Hxaro exchange among the !Kung and other social networks in small-scale societies. 

<blockquote>Q. WHY ARE THESE NETWORKS WORTH STUDYING?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. I think they are a clue to how modern humans moved out of Africa around 45,000 years ago. Unless these migrants had support systems in a founding group and could maintain ties with them, it probably wouldnt have been possible to keep pushing into unknown territory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It only took modern humans some 5,000 years to move out of Africa, cross Eurasia and end up in Australia. I think that the invention of social networks  the storing of relationships for a time when you will need them  is what facilitated this expansion.</blockquote>

The interview trends from here into the impact of Facebook on today's social networks, and the changes technology may bring to the Kalahari.
