In <a href="http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=7164">a discussion about space travel</a>, I ran across a great quote from physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedwardt_Winterberg">Friedwardt Winterberg</a> (emphasis added): 

<blockquote>...I have little taste to speculate about the surprises the physics of tomorrow might bring. It is possible that big surprises still wait for us, but the opposite is possible as well. <b>Discovering the laws of nature is like discovering America. It may happen just once.</b> I therefore like to think what is possible with what we know now.</blockquote>
