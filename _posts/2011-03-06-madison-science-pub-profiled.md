Ron Seely of the <i>Wisconsin State Journal</i> has a nice story in today's (Sunday) edition about the Madison Science Pub (<a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/entertainment/city_life/article_685ec245-54ce-5319-8641-29b1874059fe.html">"Science Pub organizer taps scientists for informal gatherings mixed with beers"</a>). Now midway through its second year, this event brings a good crowd every month to the salon-like atmosphere of the upstairs of Brocach Irish Pub, right on on Capital Square in Madison. I make an appearance in the article as the guest of the very first event two years ago, and the first repeat guest. 

<blockquote>Its not exactly a scientific formula but Skip Evans has discovered that if you combine a scientist, good beer, and a crowd of curious people, you come up with a very interesting Sunday afternoon.</blockquote>

Oh, I think that's the most likely scientific formula of all! Organizer Skip Evans really deserves recognition for keeping this event going so strong.
