You can read <i>On the Origin of Species</i> online for free. So why would you want to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674032810?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674032810"><i>The Annotated Origin</i></a> by James Costa? Because those notes are like a blog written by a friendly historian of science, sitting right beside the original text. 

The <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/Darwin/annotated.html">publisher has some sample sections</a>. I find it oddly compelling.
