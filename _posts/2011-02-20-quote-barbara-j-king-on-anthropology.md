Barbara J. King has written <a href="http://www.barbarajking.com/blog.htm?post=773398">a short essay about why she loves anthropology:</a>

<blockquote>When I do anthropology, it always starts with agitated questions. No matter how modest my contribution, as I work, I feel connected to anthropologists past and present, people who, in Papua New Guinea or Paris, in Berlin or Boston, trained themselves to see the rhino lumbering in their path. To capture from our peripheral vision something strange and exciting about human meaning-making or its evolution, to move it front and center into our minds and join those minds up with others, is a challenge and a joy.</blockquote>
