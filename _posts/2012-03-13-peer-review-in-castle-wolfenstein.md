<a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/peer-fortress/">"Peer fortress: The scientific battlefield"</a> uses first-person shooter gaming characters to put a humorous spin on scientific peer review. Six characters that might show up whenever you submit a manuscript. The one I seem to get most often is the Medic:

<blockquote>The Medic wanted to save your paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But, they ended up killing the patient.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rife with suggestions for improvement, the Medic's review somberly concludes that "even though I enjoyed the paper, it would be premature to publish these results at this time."</blockquote>
