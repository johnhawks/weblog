I'm giving a public lecture this Thursday evening at the Wisconsin Historical Society, basically an overview of Denisova Cave in the context of the archaeology of Central Asia. I'll be talking about some of the work we are doing with the archaic genomes, and I'll discuss some of the new results we have.

The lecture is in the Auditorium of the Wisconsin Historical Society building, just off Library Mall, and starts at 7:00 pm. It is sponsored by the Charles E. Brown Archaeological Society.
