Daniel MacArthur has been indispensable lately -- if you are interested in consumer genetics, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/amway_sells_genetic_tests.php">check out his post on Amway's "Heart Health" genetic tests</a>. The post refers to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/22765/page1/">an article in <i>Technology Review</i></a>, and ends: 

<blockquote>These are the types of tests that give direct-to-consumer genetic testing a bad name; careful regulation that punishes these bottom-feeders while leaving scientifically supported tests intact (i.e. the major personal genomics companies) is long overdue.</blockquote>
