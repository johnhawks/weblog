I was curious about the use of _Homo ergaster_ over time. It seems to me that fewer and fewer paleoanthropologists have been using it over the last few years. My perception (I'll share later) is not borne out by the Google Scholar statistics: More scientific papers during the last five years have mentioned _Homo ergaster_ than in any previous period.

As I was looking, I checked out Google Ngram Viewer and found this alarming result:

Wow.

Google Ngram Viewer tracks the use of words or phrases in books, and goes only up to 2008. It's pretty striking to see _Homo ergaster_ had nearly overtaken _Australopithecus afarensis_ in book mentions. These are not only popular books, they are also textbooks and technical books, so it's hard to generalize about the causes of the trends, which are overall very small compared to other hominin species (such as _Homo erectus_).

Here is another interesting comparison, considering that the main descriptive papers about  _Ardipithecus ramidus_ were not released until 2009:

Some of the decline in _Ardipithecus ramidus_ after 2000 may have been caused by the availability of _Orrorin tugenensis_ and _Sahelanthropus tchadensis_ as "first hominins" -- few popular books about human evolution can avoid naming the earliest known hominin fossils.

_Homo habilis_ and _Homo erectus_ dwarf the popular usage of any of these other species names. Books have used _Homo habilis_ three times more than _Australopithecus afarensis_ at its peak, and _Homo erectus_ appears six times more often.

The rise of _Homo ergaster_ after 1990 is in part explained by the rise of popularity of cladistics in paleoanthropology. That trend is also evident in two other species names:

By 1980, the names _Homo neanderthalensis_ and _Homo heidelbergensis_ were at the nadir of a five-decade-long decline. _Homo neanderthalensis_ was discarded mainly for the non-taxonomic "Neanderthal" (or "Neandertal"), while _Homo heidelbergensis_ lost ground partly to "early _Homo sapiens_", and later (after 1970) to "archaic _Homo sapiens_". But after 1990, cladists had revived those formal taxonomic names, arguing that both represented real species of Pleistocene humans. The "out of Africa" perspective on modern human origins helped to promote the hypothesis that the formation of new species was a common mechanism of evolutionary change throughout the Pleistocene. _Homo heidelbergensis_ was the foremost beneficiary of this viewpoint. My readers know that I don't like either of these names and prefer the non-taxonomic equivalents.

The same rise of cladistic methodology and its accompanying philosophy has spurred the use of the term "hominin" instead of the earlier term, "hominid". By 2008, "hominin" was used approximately one third as often as "hominid" according to the Ngram Viewer.
