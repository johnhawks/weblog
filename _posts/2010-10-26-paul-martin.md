Sadly, Paul Martin died last month. A reader sent along <a href="http://uanews.org/node/34237">a remembrance from the University of Arizona.</a> Martin is best known as an advocate for the "overkill" hypothesis for the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. I had not heard at the time, and I'm sure many others missed the news also. 

A very accessible account of some of Martin's work is featured in Connie Barlow's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465005527?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465005527"><i>The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, and Other Ecological Anachronisms</i></a>. I recommend this book often to students.
