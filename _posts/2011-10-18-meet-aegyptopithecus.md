At this station are casts of <em>Aegyptopithecus zeuxis</em>. This species comes from the Oligocene, approximately 30 million years ago. It is from the Fayum fossil beds of Egypt. 


Your mission is to determine which superfamily or superfamilies of primates are the closest living relatives of this fossil. Consider the teeth most closely, as they are most likely to lead you in the right direction.
