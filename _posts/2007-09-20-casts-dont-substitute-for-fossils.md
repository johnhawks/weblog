<i>Slate's</i> Scott Solomon asked some people, and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2173463/">presents a nice, short explanation</a> of why original fossils are important to paleoanthropology:
</p>

<blockquote>You can't rely on bone-length measurements taken from a cast, either, since the replicas tend to deteriorate or deform faster than original fossil material. Casts made from plaster or plastic -- such as most casts of Lucy -- often become misshapen in unpredictable ways, especially when they are repeatedly handled or moved. The problem becomes worse when new casts are made from old casts, since a copy of a copy is less likely to be accurate.</blockquote>

<p>
And then there's this:
</p>

<blockquote>The [Piltdown] forgery was not exposed until 1953, in part because many paleontologists were allowed to carefully examine only casts but not the original "fossils," which contained clues about the subterfuge.</blockquote>

<p>
The same goes for reconstructing fragmentary specimens: it is often not possible to tell which details of a cast may be determined entirely by reconstruction, and which are genuine features of the preserved anatomy.

UPDATE(2007/09/19): Wow, a lot of people didn't like this post! Don't read so much into it; the linked article is about why you don't want to lose original fossils. Casts <i>do</i> become misshapen in unpredictable ways. Later methods of analysis <i>can</i> reveal new facts about them. There are lost originals we'd like to have back; like those from Mlade&#269; and Zhoukoudian, all lost or destroyed during World War II. I guess an even better example is Vindija 33.19, which shows that some fossils can be very unique in their preservation in ways that later become very, very important. I've posted <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/casts_and_ct_scans_openness_2007.html">some new thoughts</a> related to the correspondence I've gotten.
