Worth amplifying from Dienekes' Anthropology Blog, <a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/11/y-chromosomes-of-bahamas.html">"Y chromosomes of the Bahamas"</a>: 

<blockquote>I like the line about there being substantially more Y-STR variation in E1b1a7a-U174 and E1b1ba8-U175 in the Bahamas than any African collection. I have argued for years that the central assumption of phylogeography, that the location of highest Y-STR diversity is not necessarily the point of origin of a haplogroup, since Y-STR diversity can be affected both by antiquity and by admixture. Nonetheless, I keep reading papers where tiny differences in Y-STR variation, even if we forget about the noisiness of Y-STRs themselves, are taken as evidence of ancient migrations. Thankfully, the time when Y-STRs were used to infer ancient migrations is over, and the huge collection of Y-STR haplotypes amassed by population geneticists, forensic specialists, and genealogists alike can be put to uses for which it is more amenable.</blockquote>

Once we have population mixture, hypotheses about phylogeography become much harder to test. A population model with mixture has many ways of generating the same pattern of relative diversity among populations.
