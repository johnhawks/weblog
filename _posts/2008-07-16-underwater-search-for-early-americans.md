James Adovasio is going looking for underwater early American sites off Florida, according to <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_577616.html">this article in the <i>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</i></a>: 

<blockquote>Adovasio plans to co-lead a two-week expedition in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the month to look for evidence of early American Indians along the ancient coast of Florida, now about 300 feet underwater, Mercyhurst College in Erie announced Monday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have these little hints ... that there are potentially early sites off the coast of Florida," said Adovasio, former chairman of the University of Pittsburgh's anthropology department. "That is what makes this so exciting."</blockquote>
