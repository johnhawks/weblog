Colleen Morgan is preparing for a session on blogging and archaeology at the SAA meetings later this month and has started <a href="http://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/blogging-archaeology-the-carnival/">a carnival to highlight posts from other blogs on "Blogging Archaeology"</a>. 

I'll return to the topic again, but I thought one of the first responses was just great -- from Terry P. Brock, <a href="http://dirt.terrypbrock.com/?page_id=2">"What can blogging do for archaeology."</a> He points out something that was important to me as I started blogging: 

<blockquote>Like it or not, when people have a question they want answered, they head to the Internet. And when they get there, those questions are often answered by the first things that pop up on a Google Search: Wikipedia, news magazines, and blogs. Only one of those, blogs, actually has a human being attached to it, and I think people tend to gravitate to other people who they can get to know and trust.</blockquote>
