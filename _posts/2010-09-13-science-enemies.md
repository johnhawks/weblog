Do you have a "Science Enemy"? Dr. Becca <a href="http://www.labspaces.net/blog/528/My_Science_Enemy">hilariously describes her hate-hate relationship</a> with "Science Enemy". 

<blockquote>My history with Science Enemy goes back around 10 years, when I was presenting my first ever conference poster. She was very interested in my work, and, wanting to be sociable, I casually asked her whose lab she was in. My friendly query was met with an indignant "MINE," and it's there I believe the rivalry began. I of course tried to remedy this faux pas with "Oh, it's just because you look so YOUNG!!" (and truly she did), but my conciliatory words fell on deaf ears; it was on. </blockquote>

Sounds like the time Neil Patrick Harris was on <i>Glee</i>. 

I don't know what's worse. I mean, what if you didn't think you had a rival at all, but to <i>someone else</i> you already are the ultimate Science Enemy? Is there such a thing as unrequited rivalry? I guess it would suck to be them!
