I don't have any comments on this, it's just cool: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/fruitfly-development-cell-by-cell-1.10769">"Fruitfly development, cell by cell"</a>

<blockquote>The groups behind the two articles both chose D.melanogaster embryos to image. We understand how the fly embryo works better than any other, and that comes from 100 years of genetic studies, says Michael Levine, who studies developmental genomics at the University of California at Berkeley and was not involved in the research. We have a basic blueprint of gene interaction, and this imaging technology should take the abstract blueprint and turn it into a living, breathing embryo.</blockquote>
