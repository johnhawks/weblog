I'm now back from the AAA meetings and mostly recovered. Daniel Lende's <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuroanthropology/2011/11/22/the-montreal-anthropology-meetings-recap-of-aaa-coverage/">recap of many people's coverage of the meetings</a> is an interesting place to start your morning. I'll post my own thoughts sometime later.
