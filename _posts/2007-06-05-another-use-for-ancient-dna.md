<blockquote><b>Daughters of Eve in DNA paintings</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Artist Ulla Plougmand-Turner said the experience was "amazing"<br />
An artist has created portraits of the "Seven Daughters of Eve" using paint containing reconstructed ancient DNA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Danish artist Ulla Plougmand-Turner mixed sequences of ancient DNA, produced in an Oxford laboratory, into paint to create the images.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The pictures represent seven women, from whom it is thought the majority of Europeans can trace their DNA line.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Described as "a fusion of science and art", the paintings went on exhibition on Monday at Wolfson College, Oxford.</blockquote>
