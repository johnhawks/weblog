<p>
I <a href="weblog/fossils/flores/discover_science_story_2005.html">mentioned last month</a> that the January issue of <i>Discover</i> had a list of the top 100 science stories of 2005 along with a short writeup about each. Now the magazine has put all the <a href="http://www.discover.com/issues/jan-06/features/archaeology-copy/">archaeology-related stories online</a> for free. 
</p>

<p>
They include the Mexican footprints (are they or aren't they?), the use of multispectral imaging to read faded papyri, the attempts to decode Incan khipus (knot patterns), the discovery of ancient Thracian goldwork, an artifact-looting bust, and of course the continuing <i>Homo floresiensis</i> carnival.
