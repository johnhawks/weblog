Ann Althouse <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2008/07/i-myself-find-that-i-trust-my-own.html">links</a> to <a href="http://peterstekel.com/PDF-HTML/Kurt%20Vonnegut%20advice%20to%20writers.htm">Kurt Vonnegut's "How to write with style,"</a>, which deserves to be linked. 

<blockquote>I myself find that I trust my own writing most, and others seem to trust it most, too, when I sound most like a person from Indianapolis, which is what I am. What alternatives do I have? The one most vehemently recommended by teachers has no doubt been pressed on you, as well: to write like cultivated Englishmen of a century or more ago.</blockquote>
