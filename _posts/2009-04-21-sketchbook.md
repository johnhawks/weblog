Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/harar-woman-2009.jpg" height="335" width="400" alt="Harar woman" />
</div>

I've been experimenting with some painting, so I haven't had a lot to show from my sketching lately. I started this one before the AAPA meetings, but didn't pick it up again until later. HB and 4B pencil.
