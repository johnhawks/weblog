Problems with <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18955870/">panda releases</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Panda that was released into wild dies</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>BEIJING - The first panda to be released into bamboo forests after being bred in captivity has died, and a Chinese nature preserve official said Thursday it may have fallen from trees while being chased by wild pandas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The body of Xiang Xiang was found Feb. 19 on snow-covered ground in the forests of Sichuan province in China's southwest, the Xinhua News Agency said. He survived less than a year in the wild after nearly three years of training in survival techniques and defense tactics.</blockquote>

It's very sad. Sort of like <i>West Side Story</i>. 
</p>

<p>
I wonder how you train a panda in "survival techniques and defense tactics." Does this involve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon">a Wudang master?</a> I guess not, because then they could just fly around... 
</p>

<p>
They apparently have a strategy to make being "chased by wild pandas" a good thing for the next release: 
</p>

<blockquote>"We chose Xiang Xiang because we thought that a strong male panda would have a better chance of surviving in the harsh natural environment," Li was quoted as saying. "But the other male pandas clearly saw Xiang Xiang as a threat. Next time we will choose a female panda."</blockquote>

<p>
What did I say? <i>West Side Story</i>.
