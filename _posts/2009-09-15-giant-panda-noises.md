Uhhh...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32843606/ns/technology_and_science-science/">Giant pandas sex talk revealed</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Giant pandas (also) produce barks, moans, honks, growls, roars and squeals," said Charlton, a postdoctoral research biologist at Zoo Atlanta. "In addition, females produce chirps when they are approaching and entering estrus, and some non-vocal sounds, such as the snort and chomp, which are sometimes heard."</blockquote>

So much for my mental image of prurient zookeepers.
