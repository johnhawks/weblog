From Tom Benthin, Graphic Facilitator: <a href="http://tombenthin.com/2011/05/20/rough-and-hand-drawn-alive-and-inviting/">"Rough and Hand-drawn: Alive and Inviting"</a>. 

<blockquote>Ill start by saying that I believe that drawings that are hand-made and loosely or roughly drawn engage us more, drawing us into the process of animating what were viewing. By animating I mean the way we bring a drawing to life in our mind. </blockquote>

Some examples at the link, drawing from the classics of animation. It is a lot of work to develop a distinctive simple look with characters for lecture visuals, but the personal touch can add immeasurably to people's engagement with the material.
