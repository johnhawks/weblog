Today's sketchbook: 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/egg-carton-charcoal-2009.jpg" height="266" width="400" alt="Egg carton in charcoal" />
</div>

Another sketch with the grilling charcoal. Goodwin loves to play with egg cartons lately. Not really sure why, but Hot Wheels cars are just about the size of the eggs.
