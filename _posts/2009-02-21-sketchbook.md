Today's sketchbook:

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/johnny_weissmuller_tree_sketchbook_2009.jpg" height="351" width="400" alt="Johnny Weissmuller in a tree" />
</div>

Johnny Weissmuller, the original ape-man. I love the dynamic poses in many of his stills. The studio did some dramatic lighting, shadowed portions get a little flash around the edges from backlighting.
