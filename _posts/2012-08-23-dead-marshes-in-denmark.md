ScienceNordic describes an incredible Iron Age archaeological dig in Denmark: <a href="http://sciencenordic.com/entire-army-sacrificed-bog">"An entire army sacrificed in a bog"</a>. 

<blockquote>Archaeologists have spent all summer excavating a small sample of what has turned out to be a mass grave containing skeletal remains from more than 1,000 warriors, who were killed in battle some 2,000 years ago.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The army beneath the bog may have been defeated and killed in a battlefield located far away from Alken Wetlands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hertz says that if this were the case, it must have been a massive logistical task for Iron Age people to transport the bones to the lake.</blockquote>

It's just like the Lord of the Rings! Ancient army that nobody remembers with bodies beneath the waters. Except, of course, these are bones. That sat on a battlefield to be ravaged by scavengers, and then secondarily tossed.
