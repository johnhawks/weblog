From <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/dinosaurs_sadly_extinct_before"><i>The Onion</i></a>: 

<blockquote><b>Dinosaurs Sadly Extinct Before Invention Of Bazooka</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>According to Ernest Diffey, a fossil archivist at the American Museum of Natural History, a giant asteroid struck the earth in the late Cretaceous period, forever robbing scientists of valuable data concerning the effects powerful rocket launchers might have had on the largest land animals that ever lived.</blockquote>
