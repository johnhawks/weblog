Reuters correspondent Zoran Radosavljevic <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6202EW20100301">reports on the recent opening of the new museum at Krapina, Croatia</a>. The museum is devoted to Neandertals, and represents the long work of Croat paleoanthropologist Jakov Radovcic. 

<blockquote>Visitors can touch parts of a digital Neanderthal body to get a medical explanation of their diseases and ailments - most of them very similar to our own, like knee and shoulder problems at a later age.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The central scene -- a big Neanderthal family gathered in a cave around the fire -- is particularly impressive because of the accompanying acrid smells of sweat and burning meat, and sounds meant to recreate those typical of the Stone Age.</blockquote>

The article includes a few photos of the reconstructions in the museum. This one gives an impression of the space:

I can't wait until I get a chance to visit, it looks truly impressive!
