I'm not really qualified to give chimpanzee-related advice, but...

...when your friend calls for help because her <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29227155/">200-pound Xanax-drugged chimpanzee has stolen the car keys</a>...

<blockquote>His owner, Sandra Herold, 70, had called a friend over to help when "Travis" began misbehaving at 241 Rock Rimmon Road. The chimp had taken the keys to the car. He was also trying to open car doors, which he apparently did to indicate he wanted to go for a ride. Herold was able to coax Travis back to the house and she gave him some Xanax-laced tea, police said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the friend, Charla Nash, 55, of Stamford, arrived minutes later, the 200-pound chimp bolted outside and began brutally attacking Nash as she was getting out of her car, leaving her with severe facial injuries. She was in "very critical condition," according to police, and her condition had not improved considerably Tuesday.</blockquote>

...<b>call Animal Control</b>.

Another of our periodic reminders that chimpanzees are not domesticated animals.
