<p>
I have a history of <a href="weblog/topics/humor/pig_origin_wwn_2005.html">quality pig-blogging</a> here, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4605202.stm">this BBC story</a> has all the right ingredients: 
</p>

<blockquote>Scientists in Taiwan say they have bred three pigs that glow in the dark.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They claim that while other researchers have bred partly fluorescent pigs, theirs are the only pigs in the world which are green through and through.</blockquote>

<p>
No, it wasn't enough to breed pigs that only <i>partly</i> glow green. They needed their pigs <i>green through and through</i>!
</p>

<p>
The point is to be able to find human stem cells after injection -- they will be the only ones <i>not</i> glowing. 
</p>

<p>
Yes, the story has pictures of the pigs glowing in the dark. As if you needed to ask.
</p>

<blockquote>The researchers say they hope the new, green pigs will mate with ordinary female pigs to create a new generation.</blockquote>

<p>
No, the story doesn't have any pictures of <i>that</i>!
