For two weeks I've been reading news feeds about how volcanoes killed the Neandertals. I mean, seriously: 

<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/09/volcanoes-neanderthals-extinct/1">USA Today: "Volcanoes wiped out the Neanderthals?"</a>

<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/01/100922-volcanoes-eruptions-neanderthals-science-volcanic-humans/">National Geographic: "Volcanoes Killed Off Neanderthals, Study Suggests"</a>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/science/05obneanderthal.html">NY Times: "Neanderthals Big Loss in Battle of the Elements"</a>

<a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=13000CWJXTBO">UPI: "Volcanic Winter Blamed for Neanderthal Extinction"</a>

The other stories of the last couple of weeks are some variant of <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Neanderthals-Were-Not-So-Stupid-After-All-157512.shtml">"Neanderthals Were Not So Stupid After All"</a>. They make quite a juxtaposition. 

I think they could save some print by combining the stories: "No Longer Rock-Brained, Neandertals Kiss Ash Goodbye".  Or "Neandertals Outwit Ice, Die By Fire." 

Oooh, oooh! "Misunderstood Neandertals Pursue Morose Creator To North Pole".
