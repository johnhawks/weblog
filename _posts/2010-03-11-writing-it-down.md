Daniel Lende discusses how to write anthropological work for a lay audience: <a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2010/03/03/on-reaching-a-broader-public-five-ideas-for-anthropologists/">"On Reaching a Broader Public: Five Ideas for Anthropologists."</a>

<blockquote>Unfortunately the basic anthropological storyline does not embrace a model of taking the extraordinary and making it ordinary, of making it relevant to people. Rather, we take the extraordinary and make it complicated.</blockquote>

That pull quote isn't the theme, but I quite like it as a description of the problem with a lot of anthropological writing.
