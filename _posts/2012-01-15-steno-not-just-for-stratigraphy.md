Matthew Cobb, guest-blogging at <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com">Why Evolution Is True</a>, gives an appreciation of Nicholas Steno's contributions to biology: <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/googles-doodle-women-have-eggs/">"Googles doodle: women have eggs"</a>. 

<blockquote>The testicles of women are analogous to the ovary: in other words, women have eggs. This amazing statement  almost a throwaway comment in a brief section on sharks  was the start of our modern understanding of both human reproduction, and on the essential unity of the animal kingdom.</blockquote>

Cobb is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002STNAYE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002STNAYE"><em>Generation: The Seventeenth-Century Scientists Who Unraveled the Secrets of Sex, Life, and Growth</em></a>, which goes through this interesting chapter in the history of science, with names like Steno, Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek all interconnected with each other.
