Here are some links that have been piling up in my browser tabs this week: 

<i>NY Times:</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/science/19dogs.html">"Scientists Find a Shared Gene in Dogs With Compulsive Behavior"</a>

Afarensis links <a href="http://afarensis99.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/darwinism-illustrated/#comment-8967">the Google Books archive of <i>Darwinism Illustrated</i> by George Romanes (1892).</a>

Julien Riel-Salvatore links <a href="http://averyremoteperiodindeed.blogspot.com/2010/01/prehistoric-ballistics-or-mythbusters.html">a new paper on projectile point dynamics by the Mythbusters</a>. 

In the arXiv: <a href="http://technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/24711/">"To Understand Congress, Just Watch the Sandpile"</a>

<blockquote>It turns out that the way a particular resolution gains support can be accurately simulated by the avalanches that occur when grains of sand are dropped onto each other to form a pile.</blockquote>

Gene Expression: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2010/01/rice_alcohol_and_genes.php">"Rice, alcohol and genes"</a> reviews evidence for the origin of an adaptive <i>ADH1B</i> variant in China.

The Dynamist <a href="http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/archives/003058.html">links to</a> a <a href="http://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/H.G.Wells_on_Metropolis%201927.htm">a 1927 film review of <i>Metropolis</i> by author H. G. Wells.</a> He didn't like the movie: 

<blockquote>Torches are Christian, we are asked to suppose; torches are human. Torches have hearts. But electric hand-lamps are wicked, mechanical, heartless things. The bad, bad inventor uses quite a big one. </blockquote>

The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> says that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704320104575015141536429662.html#mod=todays_us_opinion">fashion trends are out</a>. Unless you count steampunk. Maybe it's all microtrends now.
