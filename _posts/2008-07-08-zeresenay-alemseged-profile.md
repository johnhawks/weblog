The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/07/01/BASI11DS1L.DTL">a nice profile</a> of Zeresenay Alemseged, who has recently been appointed chairman of anthropology for the California Academy of Sciences:

<blockquote>Even while he is curator at the academy, Zeresenay will continue his fossil hunting in Ethiopia. He is heading back to Dikika in January - studying the region's geology and the varied animals that lived there - and, hopefully, finding the fossil bones of more Australopithecines, young or old. They might even be Salem's parents, or Lucy's other relatives - who knows?</blockquote>
