I've been sent two videos this week by several readers. I post them here together -- I've never embedded video before, and after some experimentation I didn't get it to load very well on the blog, so I'm just including links. My including them in one post is <b>not a comment on either video!</b> Just that, well <b>that's the media about human evolution this week</b>. 


1. <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-august-5-2009/human-s-closest-relative"><i>The Daily Show</i> does a bit where correspondent John Oliver interviews Jeff Schwartz and Todd Disotell about orangutan versus chimpanzees as our closest relatives.</a>

This is really funny, lampooning both sides. There is some off-color commentary, language, and sexual references (for those readers who might care). And Oliver does make an unkind reference to Disotell's mohawk. 

2. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elaine_morgan_says_we_evolved_from_aquatic_apes.html">Elaine Morgan at the TED conference describing the Aquatic Ape Theory</a>

<i>The Daily Show</i> is the top-rated news broadcast among viewers 18-34. TEDGlobal is a conference with "elite" speakers for which people pay $6000 to attend the program. Which this year included aquatic apes. 

OK, so they have one thing in common, these two videos -- I won't be showing either in class!


Many of the free TED talks are very useful for showing in classes, by the way -- check out previous paleoanthropologists include <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/louise_leakey_digs_for_humanity_s_origins.html">Louise Leakey</a> and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/zeresenay_alemseged_looks_for_humanity_s_roots.html">Zeresenay Alemseged</a>, also notable is <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/nina_jablonski_breaks_the_illusion_of_skin_color.html">Nina Jablonski on skin color</a>.
