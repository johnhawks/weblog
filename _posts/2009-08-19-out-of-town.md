I'm out of town this week, which means that (a) the Boneyard is delayed, and (b) there are actually some interesting arising topics that I haven't been able to write about. If you've e-mailed and haven't gotten a reply, sorry! Meanwhile, I have a couple of new posts and several auto-scheduled ones filling the gaps. 

If you're about to start classes and looking for stuff that might be useful for your students (or if you're a student yourself), let me recommend:
