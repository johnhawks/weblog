Jennifer Viegas <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28663444/">reports on a new study by Jill Rhodes and Steve Churchill</a>: 

<blockquote>"When engaged in overhead throwing activity, such as throwing a baseball, or a spear, this increases the movement arm of the muscles and gives greater strength and velocity to the throw," said Rhodes, a visiting assistant professor of anthropology at Bryn Mawr College.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She explained to Discovery News that modern athletes, like baseball pitchers and handball players, often show a characteristic backward displacement at the shoulder joint. Usually just one joint shows this, since most people have a preferred throwing arm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The anthropologists found this telltale skeletal characteristic in the early modern European fossils, but not in the Neanderthals.</blockquote> 

The recent bitumen hafting article by Eric Bo&euml;da and colleagues also gets a mention.
