<em>The Guardian</em> has a retrospective in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of publication of <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (and you can buy an anniversary edition: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226458121/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226458121&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20"><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions: 50th Anniversary Edition</em></a>) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/aug/19/thomas-kuhn-structure-scientific-revolutions">"Thomas Kuhn: the man who changed the way the world looked at science"</a>


<blockquote>Kuhn remained at Harvard until 1956 and, having failed to get tenure, moved to the University of California at Berkeley where he wrote Structure and was promoted to a professorship in 1961. The following year, the book was published by the University of Chicago Press. Despite the 172 pages of the first edition, Kuhn  in his characteristic, old-world scholarly style  always referred to it as a mere "sketch". He would doubtless have preferred to have written an 800-page doorstop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But in the event, the readability and relative brevity of the "sketch" was a key factor in its eventual success. Although the book was a slow starter, selling only 919 copies in 1962-3, by mid-1987 it had sold 650,000 copies and sales to date now stand at 1.4 million copies. For a cerebral work of this calibre, these are Harry Potter-scale numbers.</blockquote>

The story is a good Sunday read. As far as <em>Structure</em>, Amazon tells me that customers who bought the new edition also were likely to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316291161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316291161&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20"><em>The French Lieutenant's Woman</em></a>.
