The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9600151/">AP article</a> ends this way: 
</p>

<blockquote>Wasilewski said a 10- or 20-foot python also could pose a risk to an unwary human, especially a child. He added, however, "I don't think this is an imminent threat. This is not a 'Be afraid, be very afraid' situation."</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, I beg to differ. It begins this way: 
</p>

<blockquote>MIAMI - The alligator has some foreign competition at the top of the Everglades food chain, and the results of the struggle are horror-movie messy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A 13-foot Burmese python recently burst after it apparently tried to swallow a live, six-foot alligator whole, authorities said.</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, there are photos. 
</p>

<blockquote>The gory evidence of the latest gator-python encounter -- the fourth documented in the past three years -- was discovered and photographed last week by a helicopter pilot and wildlife researcher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The snake was found with the gator's hindquarters protruding from its midsection. Mazzotti said the alligator may have clawed at the python's stomach as the snake tried to digest it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In previous incidents, the alligator won or the battle was an apparent draw.</blockquote>

<p>
It's like Thunderdome out there!
