This station has several of the key cranial specimens of <em>Homo habilis</em>, together with Sts 5, the representative of <em>Australopithecus africanus</em>. The <em>H. habilis</em> specimens include: 

<ul>
<li>KNM-ER 1470, from Koobi Fora, Kenya, 1.9 million years old.</li>
<li>KNM-ER 1813, from Ileret, Kenya, 1.65 million years old.</li>
<li>OH 24, from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, 1.8 million years old.</li>
</ul>

Another skull, KNM-ER 1805, is also included here. This skull may also represent <em>H. habilis</em>, or it may be something else. 



<strong>What to do:</strong> Examine the <em>H. habilis</em> crania compared to <em>A. africanus</em> and early <em>Homo erectus</em>. What makes these skulls more like <em>Homo</em> than <em>Australopithecus</em>? 



KNM-ER 1470 and KNM-ER 1813 are very different in size. Are they male and female of the same species, or do you think they are different species?



What is KNM-ER 1805?
