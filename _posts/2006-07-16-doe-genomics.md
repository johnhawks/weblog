It's a good rundown, including radiation research into mutations and research into new biofuels. It might also mention the interest in finding microbial agents to clean up chemicals of various kinds. As the Neandertal metagenomics stuff starts coming online, some folks might be interested in the history of DOE involvement in genomics, and this is a good place to start.
