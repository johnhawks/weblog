Mystery Rays from Outer Space <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2007/10/09/heavyweight-championship-overdominance-vs-frequency-dependent-selection/">wrote earlier this month about the pattern of selection on MHC</a>, bringing up the question of whether overdominance (heterozygote advantage) or frequency dependence is the reigning pattern. This post focuses on some evidence supporting the hypothesis of frequency dependence.

<blockquote>Even on a short scale, alleles appear and disappear at a great rate. My favourite example of this is the map on the right 8 (I liked it so much I scanned it, years ago; I don't have access to the 1996 issues of Science on line. Click on the map for a larger version). This shows what happened to MHC diversity during the peopling of the Americas. You can see new alleles popping up down the migration route -- but the key point I want to make is made by the authors in a different paper: <i>"Although many new HLA-B alleles have been produced in Latin America, their net effect has been to differentiate populations, not to increase allele diversity within a population."</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, rare old MHC alleles are not selected, but disappear, while rare new alleles are selected. This is consistent with the predictions of frequency-dependent selection than of overdominance, I think. But there are also lots of strong arguments for overdominant selection, some of which I'll mention next time around.</blockquote>

The post is notable for links back into the literature, and it will be interesting to see his next installment. Also in recent weeks he has posted <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2007/10/15/mhc-molecules-the-sitcom/">a short review of the MHC molecules</a>, and <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2007/10/07/it-was-twenty-years-ago-today/">a look at how the structure of HLA-A2 was worked out</a>. 
</p>

<blockquote>That figure shows a little bit of undefined, unresolved mist (in pink) in the middle of the reasonably well-defined HLA-A2 molecule. The location of that little bit of mist, and its very mistiness, were the stunning part of the paper.</blockquote>

Oh, and <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2007/10/11/creepy-cancer-post-of-the-month/">a nice little post</a> about MHC and the Tasmanian Devil tumor problem</a>. That's a good one for Halloween.
