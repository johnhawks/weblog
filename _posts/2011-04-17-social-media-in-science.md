Last month, Virginia Gewin put an article in <i>Nature</i> about social media and science, which is now available online for free: <a href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/110331/full/nj7340-667a.html">"Social media: Self-reflection, online"</a>. 

<blockquote>The Internet is markedly changing how science  and scientists  are perceived. Publications are lauded or rebuked in the Twittersphere (see Nature 469, 286287; 2011), and leaked e-mails can escalate into political controversy, as in the case of 'climategate' (see Nature 468, 345; 2010). Scientists can also now engage with the public in new and innovative ways, as demonstrated by a researcher who was contacted about his ancestry after publishing his genome on the Internet (see Nature 468, 880881; 2010). Even if you never pay attention to the online world and don't want anything to do with it, it's bleeding into your real life, says Liz Neeley, the Seattle-based assistant director of science outreach at the Communication Partnership for Science and the Sea, an organization that helps scientists to engage with the public.</blockquote>

Gewin spoke to several blogging and tweeting scientists, and I get to play a small part as the voice of moderation. A range of people at different career stages get a few words to describe how blogging and social media fit into their strategy. 

Along similar lines is an article from <i>The Scientist</i> late last year: <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2010/10/1/83/1/">"You aren't blogging yet?"</a> It's sort of a howto featuring Bora Zivkovic and Jonathan Eisen, among others. 

Science is a realm in which many highly motivated and smart people are competing for a limited number of jobs. There are many ways to put your work forward, and blogging can be one of them. I never discount that the biggest factor is luck. But 90 percent of luck is standing in the right place at the right time. The beauty of a blog is that it's standing there waiting all the time for the right person to look.
