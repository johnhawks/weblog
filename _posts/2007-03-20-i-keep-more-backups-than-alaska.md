I wouldn't have figured it, but it's true:

<blockquote>JUNEAU, Alaska: Perhaps you know that sinking feeling when a single keystroke accidentally destroys hours of work. Now imagine wiping out a disk drive containing information for an account worth $38 billion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That is what happened to a computer technician reformatting a disk drive at the Alaska Department of Revenue. While doing routine maintenance work, the technician accidentally deleted applicant information for an oil-funded account - one of Alaska residents' biggest perks - and mistakenly reformatted the backup drive, as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There was still hope, until the department discovered its third line of defense, backup tapes, were unreadable.</blockquote>

<p>
"Three lines of defense" is charitable; we're talking about two backups, in one location. What if there were a fire? I may be paranoid, but I keep five current backups in three locations, in addition to a series of older backups on disc.

For Alaska, it cost $200,000 to rescan the paper records. If you're an impoverished graduate student reading this, consider who will retype your dissertation -- or worse, re-collect your data. Backup often!
