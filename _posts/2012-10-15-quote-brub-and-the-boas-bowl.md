Michael Brub writes in the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>: <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Resigned-the-Paterno/134944/">"Why I Resigned the Paterno Chair"</a>, with a discussion of academics versus athletics. I'm linking because of this: 

<blockquote>The day thousands of alumni cheer "We are Penn State" in celebration of the fact that the anthropology department is No. 1 nationally (having defeated Duke in the prestigious Boas Bowl) will be the day we know we've changed the culture in Happy Valley.</blockquote>

Somehow I don't see it happening, although a Boas Bowl would be entertaining.
