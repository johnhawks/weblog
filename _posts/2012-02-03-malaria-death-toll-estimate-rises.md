Notable, from the <em>Guardian</em>: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/03/malaria-deaths-research">"Malaria kills twice as many people as previously thought, research finds"</a>.

<blockquote>The study demolishes conventional thinking on malaria  that almost all the deaths are in babies and small children under the age of five. The study found that 42% were in older children and adults.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You learn in medical school that people exposed to malaria as children develop immunity and rarely die from malaria as adults," said Murray, IHME director and the study's lead author. "What we have found in hospital records, death records, surveys and other sources shows that just is not the case."</blockquote>

It will take some figuring to work out what that means relative to births in areas where malaria is endemic, but we can add to the higher death toll the clear long-term costs of malaria even to its survivors.
