The <em>Orange County Register</em> covers the final exhibition of the famous "Lucy" skeleton in the United States, at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California: <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/lucy-496080-human-ethiopia.html">"Famous fossil Lucy makes a final stop at Bowers"</a>.

<blockquote>Lucy returned to the Houston Museum of Natural Science, where her remains were kept in storage for about four years. Thus, the Bowers waited for about five years to present this show.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I think the Ethiopians thought it was time to let it rest," Keller said. "Frankly, the rumor was that the Americans stole Lucy and she's never coming back. And, of course, anyone in government there knew that that was not the case."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Recently, Ethiopia expressed a desire to bring Lucy back, particularly so an exhibit at the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa could coincide with the African Union's next meeting in May.</blockquote>

Four years is 10 percent of the time Lucy has been out of the ground.
