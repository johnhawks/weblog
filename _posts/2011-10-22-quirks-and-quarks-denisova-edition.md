I was interviewed last month for the CBC radio broadcast, "Quirks and Quarks". They have done a segment on the Denisova genome, with contributions from David Reich, Peter Parham, Chris Stringer and me, and it's part of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2011/10/22/october-22-2011/">this week's episode</a> of the show.
