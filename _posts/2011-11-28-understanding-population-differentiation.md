This lab has a take-home assignment, which is worth three points when you turn it in at next week's lab section.

The genetic differentiation among populations is very important to understanding human diversity and its historical origins. The basic measurement of population differentiation is <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub>. You will be designing and providing the solution to a problem involving <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub>. 

<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/explainer/laboratory/measuring-fst">"Measuring population subdivision"</a> exercise as an example to follow.</li>
<li>You can also refer to <a href="http://johnhawks.net/explainer/genetics/measuring-difference-between-populations">the "Measuring differences between populations" text</a>.</li>
<li>Design a story problem with three populations.</li>
<li>Your problem should involve a single gene locus, with two alleles. Each of the three populations should have a frequency for each allele (remember, the two will add to 100%).</li>
<li>Show how <em>F</em><sub>ST</sub> should be calculated in your problem, with your allele frequencies.</li>
<li>Use 1-2 sentences to explain what aspect of population differentiation your problem helps to illustrate. For example, does it show an example with one extremely different population? With very similar populations?</li>
</ol>

Bring your story problem back to lab next week.
