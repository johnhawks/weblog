The <i>Times</i> Online has a short profile of Chris Stringer, with relation to the ancient Britain project. I just love the way it starts: 
</p>

<blockquote>Shortly after marrying an archaeologist, Agatha Christie remarked: "An archaeologist is the best husband any woman can have. The older she gets, the more interested he is in her."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor Chris Stringer considers this as he makes his way through a maze of steel cupboards at the back of the Natural History Museum. His partner, Angela, is approaching her fiftieth birthday, but to interest him professionally she would need to be a good deal older: "Any younger than 10,000 years and I lose interest."</blockquote>

That is soooo cute!
