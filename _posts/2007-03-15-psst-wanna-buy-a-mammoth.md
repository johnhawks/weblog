A <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17618668/">local story</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>MILWAUKEE - A 76-year-old Kenosha County man in whose cornfield the skeleton of a mammoth believed to be about 12,500 years old was dug up in 1994 is interested in selling it, and officials of the Milwaukee Public Museum are interested in it.</blockquote>

<p>
He's got the mammoth in wooden crates in his basement. 
</p>

<blockquote>Experts have suggested the bones could be worth from between $100,000 to $500,000.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hebior [the owner] said an effort to sell the bones several years ago failed because the bids that came in were too low.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A number of Siberian mammoth skeletons sold after the fall of the Soviet Union might have suppressed the market, said Dan Joyce, senior curator of the Kenosha Public Museum.</blockquote>

<p>
That gives a whole new meaning to "bioprospecting!"
