<blockquote><b>Curry and cauliflower could halt prostate cancer</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Rutgers researchers have found that the curry spice turmeric holds real potential for the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer, particularly when combined with certain vegetables.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The scientists tested turmeric, also known as curcumin, along with phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring substance particularly abundant in a group of vegetables that includes watercress, cabbage, winter cress, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, cauliflower, kohlrabi and turnips. "The bottom line is that PEITC and curcumin, alone or in combination, demonstrate significant cancer-preventive qualities in laboratory mice, and the combination of PEITC and curcumin could be effective in treating established prostate cancers," said Ah-Ng Tony Kong, a professor of pharmaceutics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.</blockquote>

Now, see, I wouldn't post this except, well, <i>we just had cauliflower curry for supper last night!</i>

<p>
And I suppose if the headline were, "Curry and cauliflower deadlier than fugu", I would be worried.

<p>
Have to accentuate the positive, right?
