For readers and friends in the Lansing area, I'll be giving <a href="https://vprgs.msu.edu/event/vprgs-speaker-series-hybrids-and-ghosts">a lecture at Michigan State University on Thursday, October 4.</a>. The talk is in the International Center room 115, at 2:15 pm.

Here's a promo:

<strong>Hybrids and Ghosts: How ancient DNA and new fossils are changing the science of human origins.</strong>

<em>John Hawks is delivering a lecture on Ancient DNA & Human Origins. The rapidly changing field of ancient DNA has settled into a kind of normal science, as several teams of researchers have coalesced around a set of approaches to discover the genetic relationships among ancient peoples.</em>

I'll be talking about Neandertals, Denisovans, and various signatures of other ancestral human populations, as well as the increasingly complex fossil record.
