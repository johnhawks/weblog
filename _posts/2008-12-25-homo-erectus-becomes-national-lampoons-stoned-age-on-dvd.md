I commented on the movie version of the play, "Homo erectus," when I heard about it a couple of years ago, in <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/news/homo_erectus_movie_cast_2005.html">a timeless post</a>, titled "[Tom] Arnold will play Rog, a gay caveman."

Well, as might have been expected from a kooky caveman comedy featuring Gary Busey and porn star Ron Jeremy, "Homo erectus" failed to find an audience. 

But not all the news is bad. Now the movie <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/The-Stoned-Age-Arrives-In-January-13897.html">has been picked up by the masters of comedic judgment</a>:

<blockquote>Its hard to believe its been almost two years since we interviewed Adam Rifkin about his film Homo Erectus. Unfortunately, the caveman comedy never got a wide release, but there is hope for it on DVD - this is the kind of movie that smacks of becoming a cult favorite. Dont look for it under the old name though. When the picture was picked up by National Lampoons, it received a title change - National Lampoons Stoned Age, which hits DVD on January 20th. </blockquote>

<blockquote>My first reaction to the title was that it sounds a lot more sophomoric than the cultural commentary Rifkin told me about during our interview. Then again, Homo Erectus wasnt exactly a title that said high class satire, so if National Lampoons thinks this is a good title change, so be it - its not like theyve been wrong before. </blockquote>

So at last, you can own it yourself. Here's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GMH8VA?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001GMH8VA">National Lampoon's Stoned Age</a> at Amazon:

But don't confuse it for the 1994 movie of a very similar title, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305468508?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=6305468508">The Stoned Age</a>. Which you might actually prefer, if you tend to go for sleeper classics with bong humor:

Hey, whatever floats your boat. Just don't get either of them for <i>me</i>...
