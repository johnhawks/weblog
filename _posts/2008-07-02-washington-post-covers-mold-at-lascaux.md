Molly Moore of the <i>Washington Post</i> turns in <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25469429/">a nice report</a> on the problems facing Lascaux, about which <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/conservation/sites/lascaux_fungus_troubles_2008.html">I wrote earlier this year</a>:

<blockquote>"Microbiologists and geologists say we have to observe and understand what's happening first, that we can't disturb the cave. They don't agree with the treatment," [Marie-Anne] Sire said. "Other groups say the risk is too big to watch and take no action."</blockquote>

According to the article, Lascaux II, the reproduction cave for tourists, is also facing trouble: the works are fading.
