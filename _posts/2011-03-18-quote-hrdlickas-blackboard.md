Here's a quote from Ales Hrdlicka's report on "Lansing Man" -- a skeleton found near Lansing, Kansas in 1902, which was proposed as extremely early evidence of humans in the New World. Hrdlicka made it his business to examine such finds with a critical eye, he was the first physical anthropologist to espouse the theory that New World peoples reached the Americas by the Bering Strait route relatively recently. 

<blockquote>The bones are quite hard and not very brittle; they are not sufficiently chalky to mark a blackboard. They fully preserve their structure and exhibit no visible traces of fossilization.</blockquote>

This just has me giggling. The thing is, I know exactly what he's talking about -- I've studied many skeletal remains where they <i>would</i> be chalky enough to mark a blackboard.
