Gary Marcus <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gary-marcus/unintelligent-design_b_110082.html">contributes an article</a> to the Huffington Post, reflecting on the new Louisiana creationism law:

<blockquote>At this point, 30 years after the Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and his late collaborator Amos Tversky started documenting a rash of fallacies in human reasoning, the idea that the human mind would be "perfect in His image" is as outdated (and narcissistic) as the idea that the solar system would revolve around the planet earth.</blockquote>

Marcus' new book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618879641?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0618879641">Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind</a>. I'll be reviewing it here in the next few weeks.
