There aren't many details about the site, but the Independent has <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article1761669.ece">the best story</a> about it: 
</p>

<blockquote>French and Belgian archaeologists have found proof that Neanderthals - mankind's closest relatives - were living in near-tropical conditions, hunting rhinoceros and elephant, close to what is now France's Channel coast 125,000 years ago.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jean-Luc Locht, a Belgian expert in prehistory at the French government's archaeological service, was a researcher at Caours. "This is a very important site, a unique site," he said. "It proves that Neanderthals thrived in a warm north-west Europe and hunted animals like the rhinoceros and the aurochs, just as they previously, and later, hunted ice-age species like the mammoth and the reindeer.</blockquote>
