<i>Science</i> magazine's "Origins" blog is running <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/03/stone-tool-making-101-the-mind.html">a little feature by archaeology student Steven Goldstein</a> on how to knap a handaxe. 

<blockquote>Ive had a lifelong interest in archaeology, and to better understand the process of making chipped stone tools, I began teaching myself how to replicate them. I started with Oldowan tools and eventually moved up to Neolithic and New World materials. Heres what I do, and what I think, while I make an Acheulean hand ax, which early humans created about 1 million years ago.</blockquote>

On the same topic, I continue to recommend <a href="http://www.ele.net/">Tony Baker's site</a>, which takes a practical view of stone tool production from the perspective of an experienced knapper. His <a href="http://www.ele.net/acheulean/handaxe.htm">Acheulean essay</a> in particular is a thought-provoking exposition of the idea that handaxes were flake cores rather than finished artifacts.
