Earnest Hooton, on p. 170 of <i>Up From the Ape</i>: 

<blockquote>Professor William K. Gregory is the outstanding student of dental evolution, and we must attempt to secure from his works the main facts and principles of this important field of evidence. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task, because <b>the odontologists have barricaded their science with a fearsome and intricate terminology</b> and because they base great conclusions upon detailed and minute differences in tooth form which often are hardly discernible to laymen.</blockquote>

Emphasis added.
