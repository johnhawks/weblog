Anthropology and technology combine in a Sarah Bakewell piece about the most recent Channel swimmer, Karen Throsby: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/man-progress-adding-technology">"Man is a work in progress, constantly adding technology"</a>. Purists pooh-pooh anyone who swims the Channel in a wetsuit.

<blockquote>Throsby's contribution was to remind us that even something as elementally "human" as marathon swimming involves many artificial techniques: gaining weight, acclimatising to the cold, monitoring one's psychology, and developing new micro-senses  an awareness of tiny differences in water temperature, a heightened kinetic sense of the body's balance and position, and so on. It means self-transformation, and is filled with "uncountable, mundane bodily technologies". Channel swimmers use rubber caps, sunblock, Vaseline to prevent chafing, sleek swimsuits and energy-boosting snacks. They are accompanied by boats with GPS.</blockquote>

I can't believe there are Channel-swimming purists. I mean, if they brought back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Kellerman">Annette Kellerman</a>, they'd still find a woman in a full-body suit.

Of course the technology that accompanies the body is only one aspect of Channel swimming. The technology <em>inside the head</em> is even more essential; a product of training, pacing, knowledge about risks and methods, contingency plans and logistics. I often use Channel crossing swimmers as an example of human potential, an incredible achievement for a primate body made possible by a human brain.
