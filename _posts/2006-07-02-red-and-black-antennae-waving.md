<p>
I am more or less fascinated by these <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9436">ants who count their steps</a> to find their way home. It's just that we use such a massive amount of cognitive overhead for any kind of counting -- with our numeric symbol sets, and language acquisition, and so on -- and here these <i>ants</i> are counting perfectly well (and more accurately than us most of the time, I presume) by just using some kind of <i>ticker</i>.

<p>
That, and the whole concept of putting tiny <i>stilts</i> on the ants to screw up their stride lengths.
