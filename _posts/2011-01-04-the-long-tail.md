Do <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/st_thompson_short_long/">texts and tweets "change the nature of in-depth analysis"?</a> <i>Wired</i> commentator Clive Thompson thinks so, because they take away the impetus for "middle-form" reporting, which alerts readers to an event along with brief (usually uninformative) commentary. 

Personally, I can't handle reading texts and tweets but I see the point because most of my new readers find me through links to my long-form pieces. 

<blockquote>The long take also thrives on the long tail. Whereas a tweet becomes dated within minutes, a really smart long take holds value for years. Back in the 90s, my magazine articles vanished after the issue left the newsstand. But now that the pieces are online, readers email me every week saying theyve stumbled upon something years old.</blockquote>
