The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> sent reporter Christopher Borrelli to the Field Museum to see how bodies are reduced to skeletons: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-flesh-eating-beetles-field-museum-20141027-column.html#page=1">"Inside the Field Museum's hidden flesh-eating beetle room"</a>. 


<blockquote>There are nine beetle cages, each roughly the size of a home aquarium, each topped with mesh lids, each layered with a sedimentary bedrock of exoskeleton, excrement and freshly dead flesh-eating beetles. As Goldman lifted the lid of a cage and sifted around the white ribs and skull of a raven, she considered how many beetles were in this room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She decided she didn't know â€” millions? Occupancy rates are unknown.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, to shiver your spines: The flesh-eating beetles of the Field Museum are a bit of a mystery. A stray dead chipmunk or two aside, "everything in this museum is documented, even the most mundane objects," Goldman said. "Yet these beetles: It's completely unknown how we got them. When I came here I was curious (about where they came from). This colony is a black hole.</blockquote>

It's a great story for Halloween week, complete with creepy slideshow.
