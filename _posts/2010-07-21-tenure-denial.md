If you need something to heat up your July, you can check out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/07/19/what-if-college-tenure-dies?nl=opinion&emc=tya3">the <i>NY Times</i> forum, "What if College Tenure Dies?"</a>. 

It makes an interesting pool: Imagine five academics given the assignment to make their best argument for or against tenure, in 500 words or less. How many words will they waste, on average? I'd say the winning number is 350.
