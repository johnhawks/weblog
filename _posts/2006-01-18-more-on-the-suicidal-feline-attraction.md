<p>
I covered <a href="weblog/reviews/behavior/toxoplasma_infection_2005.html">this story earlier</a>, here's a bit more (from <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/stronger_link_between_cat_faeces_schizophrenia_9792">Science Blog</a>): 
</p>

<blockquote>Researchers have found stronger evidence for a link between a parasite in cat faeces and undercooked meat and an increased risk of schizophrenia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>The researchers tested anti-psychotic and mood stabilising medications used for the treatment of schizophrenia on rats infected with <i>T. gondii</i> and found they were as, or more, effective at preventing behaviourial alterations as anti-<i>T. gondii</i> drugs. This led them to believe that <i>T. gondii</i> may have a role in the development of some cases of schizophrenia.</blockquote>

<p>
So (here's a reverse) they found that treating the neurological symptoms had the same effect as treating the infection. It reads like another iteration of the <i>H. pylori</i>-gastric ulcer connection, although they are careful to note that it can explain at best a fraction of cases of schizophrenia.

<p>
Hopefully the treatment will work on some people. The story says that clinical trials on humans have already begun.
