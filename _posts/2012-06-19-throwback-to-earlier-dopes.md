In its continuing series of Olympics lead-ups, the <em>Guardian</em> enters this one: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style">"Sports doping, Victorian style"</a>. The story covers the great scandal of coca leaf chewing and its effects on the study of protein in muscle. 

<blockquote>Weston's other favourite tonic  which he thought more effective than coca leaves  was Liebig's Extract of Meat. By 1908 this was the familiar household brand Oxo, and Oxo was the official caterer of the 1908 Olympic Marathon. Runners were given it for free, with the organisers' blessing.</blockquote>
