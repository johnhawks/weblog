The Obama Administration's Office of Science and Technology Policy is running a forum on public access to federally funded research. There seem to be ongoing events and commentary on this topic, and I'll just point people to <a href="http://blog.ostp.gov/2009/12/10/policy-forum-on-public-access-to-federally-funded-research-implementation/">the initial call for comments</a> on the OSTP blog. 

The background question is whether other federal agencies (such as NSF) should enact policies similar to the NIH public access after one year condition. The comments so far seem to be running in favor of total public access to federally funded research results, which would be my position also. 

I think in this case it may be more productive to wait for a more formal opportunity to register opinions, as "blog comments" on a government website may have limited impact. But I like the way the "forum" seems to be going.
