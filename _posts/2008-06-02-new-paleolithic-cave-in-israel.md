Few details, as work is just underway. No dates. This is from <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/galilee-cave-reveals-secrets-of-huntergatherers-834599.html">a story in the <i>Independent</i> (UK)</a>:

<blockquote>Workers constructing a sewage line through a forest in northern Israel stumbled across a large cave containing stalactites and strewn with discarded fragments of prehistoric tools and the burnt bones of animals which have long been extinct in the region, including red deer, fallow deer, buffalo and even bears.</blockquote>

The article refers to a "number of chambers, the main one measuring 60 m by 80 m."
