No.

Oh, you know I can't manage a one-word post here. I can't get the paper yet -- now <i>Nature</i> has moved to the annoying press-release-long-before-paper-appears model! But I haven't read anything in the press yet that makes any sense. <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news129132016.html">Most stories</a> (and <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyPUPQgA8FQIyQUWiM0kPawLh3zw">here</a>) just seem to be press-release-regurges. 
</p>

<p>
To me, this is the key passage:
</p>

<blockquote>The team goes back over the same well-known set of specimens, but uses a different approach to analyse it, focussing in particular on a set of fundamental yet long-term changes in skull shape. </blockquote>

<blockquote>They took digital 3D images of the casts of 17 hominid specimens as well as from a gorilla, chimpanzee and H. sapiens. </blockquote>

<p>
Well, that certainly sounds like the way we teach 100-level hominid phylogeny labs when we only have 17 casts. But it doesn't sound very much like the kind of careful character analysis that ought to go into a test of a phylogenetic hypothesis.

UPDATE(2008/05/06): More thoughts upon reading the paper <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/evolution/bushes_and_ladders/gonzalez-jose-phylogeny-2-2008.html">here</a>.
