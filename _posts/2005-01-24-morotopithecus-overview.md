The site of Moroto, in Uganda, has produced a few ape fossils dating to around 20 million years ago, including a large palate and partial face. The palate is approximately the size of a female gorilla, and postcranial bones including vertebral and femoral portions estimate a mass of around 50 kg, about the size of the largest <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/proconsul/"><i>Proconsul</i></a> species. The preserved lumbar vertebra indicates that the lower spine was short and relatively inflexible, as in living apes, and may indicate a much greater degree of vertical climbing ability than in <i>Proconsul</i> (Gebo et al. 1997). This vertebral evidence may represent the earliest locomotor adaptation that was fundamentally like living apes, and unlike the quadrupedal ancestral hominoids such as <i>Proconsul</i>.
