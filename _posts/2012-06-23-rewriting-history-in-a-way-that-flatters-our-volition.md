Alex Stone, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061766216/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061766216"><em>Fooling Houdini: Magicians, Mentalists, Math Geeks, and the Hidden Powers of the Mind</em></a>, gives a short account of the psychological insights from magic tricks in the <em>NY Times</em>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/opinion/sunday/your-brain-on-a-magic-trick.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss">"Your brain on a magic trick"</a>.

<blockquote>Such tricks suggest that we are often blind to the results of our own decisions. Once a choice is made, our minds tend to rewrite history in a way that flatters our volition, a fact magicians have exploited for centuries. If you are given a choice, you believe you have acted freely, said Teller, of the duo Penn and Teller, to Smithsonian magazine. This is one of the darkest of all psychological secrets.</blockquote>
