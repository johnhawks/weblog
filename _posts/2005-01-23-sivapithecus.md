<i>Sivapithecus</i> includes a great diversity of Miocene ape species from South Asia. Fossils are known from between 10 and 7 million years ago, with many fossils recovered from the Siwalik region of Pakistan, but fossils assigned to <i>Sivapithecus</i> are found as far as China and Turkey. <i>Sivapithecus</i> represents the large radiation of the fossil Asian apes, and one or more forms are ancestral both to <a href="weblog/topics/apes/orangutans/">living orangutans</a> as well as many fossil apes, including <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/lufengpithecus/"><i>Lufengpithecus</i></a> and <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/gigantopithecus/"><i>Gigantopithecus</i></a>.

The cranial morphology of at least one specimen of <i>Sivapithecus</i> clearly shows its relation to living orangutans. Like orangutans, <i>Sivapithecus</i> had a concave face, with projecting incisors and large canines. The face curves markedly upward in profile, a condition called airorhynchy. Also, the orbits are shaped like elongated ovals, tall from top to bottom, and with a similar orientation of the tear ducts in the inner corners of the orbits.

<p>
There are dental differences between <i>Sivapithecus</i> and living orangutans. Both apes have thick molar enamel, but in orangutans, the enamel of orangutans is wrinkled into complicated tooth surfaces. In contrast, the surfaces of <i>Sivapithecus</i> teeth are basically uncomplicated and similar in form to <i>Dryopithecus</i>. This primitive molar form is also similar to early hominids, and some of the earliest-known specimens of <i>Sivapithecus</i> were once believed by many paleoanthropologists to be hominid ancestors (see <a href="weblog/fossils/apes/ramapithecus/"><i>Ramapithecus</i></a>). From later discoveries, it has become clear that <i>Sivapithecus</i> was already removed from the line of descent of the living African apes and humans.
