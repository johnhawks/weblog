Jerry Coyne points to the extreme changes made possible by artificial breeding of dogs within the last 150 years: <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/dog-breeding-the-debasement-of-the-american-cocker-spaniel/">"Dog breeding: the debasement of the American cocker spaniel"</a>. One can look at the situation as an ecological change: former working dogs are now selected for their appearance much more than for their ability to do their former jobs. WIth attendant side effects.
