Dienekes came up with his <a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2006/01/looking-forward-to-in-2006.html">own set of predictions</a> for next year. I have to say I love this one: 
</p>

<blockquote>At least one paper from the Genographic project in a venue other than National Geographic about some obscure people that no one has heard about but everyone will talk about for days. The paper will have a feel-good message about the unity of mankind.</blockquote>
