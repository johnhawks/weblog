I saw this: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15180831">"India launches Aakash tablet computer priced at $35"</a> on <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/10/05/1711248/india-launches-35-tablet">Slashdot</a>, which notes:

<blockquote> The Aakash computer runs Android 2.2 (Froyo), has a 7-inch touch screen, 256MB of RAM, 32GB expandable memory slot, two USB ports, and weighs in at only 350 grams.</blockquote>

I just want to note that 21 years ago I bought my first computer for $1700. It came with 2MB or RAM and 40MB of hard disk, 1 serial and 1 parallel port, and it weighed roughly 35 pounds. I know many readers can tell much scarier ghost stories about early computers, but those stats just struck me.
