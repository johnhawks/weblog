From <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22152482/">Reuters</a>:

<blockquote>BOSTON - A Christian biologist is suing the prestigious Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, claiming he was fired for refusing to accept evolution, lawyers involved in the case said on Friday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Nathaniel] Abraham, who was dismissed eight months after he was hired, said he was willing to do research using evolutionary concepts but that he had been required to accept Darwin's theory of evolution as scientific fact or lose his job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination dismissed the case this year, saying Abraham's request not to work on evolutionary aspects of research would be difficult for Woods Hole because its work is based on evolutionary theories.</blockquote>

Saying it would be "difficult" is an understatement. It is hard for me to understand how you could rationalize the use of a model organism like zebrafish (this person's subject) without an evolutionary framework.
