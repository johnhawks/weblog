On November 13, most PBS stations will be showing a Nova episode called, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/">Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial."</a> The film mixes interviews with re-enactments of courtroom testimony. 
</p>

<p>
The Nova website has some background materials including <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/apsell.html">an interesting interview</a> with Nova producer Paula Apsell. Here's a quote explaining the use of re-enactments: 
</p>

<blockquote>Q: NOVA is a documentary series. Why do dramatic recreations at all?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apsell: We are always cautious in making the decision to use recreations. Kitzmiller v. Dover is a landmark case that we wanted to cover, and there simply isn't any footage of the trial since cameras and recording devices are banned from federal courtrooms. We decided that the best way to tell the story was to provide direct, verbatim access to the trial through court transcripts. Dramatic reenactment allowed us to do that.</blockquote>

It will be interesting to see how they tell the story.
