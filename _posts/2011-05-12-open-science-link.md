David Dobbs writes about the structural barriers to more open science: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/free-science-one-paper-at-a-time-2">"Free Science, One Paper at a Time"</a>. Summing up a large collaboration on Alzheimer's research, he writes: 

<blockquote>The language used here  everything entering the public domain, the dismantling of silos, the parking of egos and IP padlocks  might have been lifted from an open-science manifesto. And even Big Science appreciated the outcome. To open-science advocates, this raises a good and somewhat obvious question: Why dont we do science like this all the time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Part of the answer, strangely, is the very thing at the center of science: the paper. Once sciences main conduit, the paper has become its choke point.</blockquote>

He discusses a number of new initiatives to assess researchers' activity in areas other than paper publishing, as well as strategies for post-publication review of research -- the kinds of incentives and technologies that might ease the paper publication bottleneck. 

Dobbs doesn't explicitly mention the high pressure to cram significant results into a single high-profile publication. I find this pressure in paleoanthropology to be worse than most other factors. Researchers <i>hold up</i> results so that they will have enough to get that <i>Science</i> or <i>Nature</i> publication. And then, the results are reported in a highly obfuscated way, because they are tacked into a supplement without much editing or review. The paper itself is usually all conclusions and discussion, with no discussion of methods. This allows some research groups to claim that a <i>Science</i> or <i>Nature</i> publication isn't a <i>"real"</i> publication of their results, because a more detailed monograph is necessary to report them fully. 

In other words, it's six different kinds of barrier to open science, all rolled up into one basic problem.
