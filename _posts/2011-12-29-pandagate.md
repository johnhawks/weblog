I have to note this brouhaha from across the Atlantic: along with Pippa Middleton, Gabrielle Giffords and others...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8980607/BBC-criticised-for-naming-panda-as-a-woman-of-the-year.html">BBC criticised for naming panda as a woman of the year</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>John Prescott took to his Twitter account and said: "So the BBC couldn't find a woman for Sports Personality of the Year but they could find a panda for a female face of 2011 #pandagate."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Labour MP Stella Creasy said: "No offence to sweetie  sure a lovely panda and best in class etc- but clue is in title 'women' not 'female of the species' of the year ..."</blockquote>

Lovely.
