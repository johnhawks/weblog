<em>The Guardian</em> reports on a recent cave art discovery in Spain: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/27/spanish-archaeologists-discover-cave-art-axturra-paleolithic?CMP=share_btn_fb">"Spanish archaeologists discover cave art to rival country's best"</a>. 

<blockquote>Chief site archaeologist Diego Garate said that an estimated 70 drawings were found on ledges 300m (1,000 ft) underground in the Atxurra cave in the northern Basque region. He described the site as being in “the Champions League” of cave art and among the top 10 sites in Europe. The engravings and paintings feature horses, buffalo, goats and deer, dating back 12,500-14,500 years.</blockquote>

If significant cave art remains undiscovered in Spain, imagine what that says about how little we know in the rest of the world.
