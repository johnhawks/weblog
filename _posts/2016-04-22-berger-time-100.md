Lee Berger had been named one of the "Pioneers" in <a href="http://time.com/4302420/lee-berger-2016-time-100/">the Time 100 Most Influential People</a>. It's quite an accomplishment for any anthropologist to make such a list, and it's great to see the impact of recent fossil hominin discoveries ranking among the most significant news items in the world.
