So <i>Science</i> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/314/5807/1848">named</a> the Poincar&eacute; conjecture proof as the "breakthrough of the year." I got my year-end <i>Discover</i> a couple of weeks ago, and they said this: 
</p>

<blockquote>If, in the year 2100, <i>DISCOVER</i> runs a feature on the top advances in science in the 21st century, the proof of the Poincar&eacute; conjecture is still likely to be the number-one sory in mathematics.</blockquote>

<p>
I thought that was really funny, because they made it <b>only number 8 for the year!</b> "Sucks to be a mathematician," I thought!
</p>

<p>
The number two breakthrough, according to <i>Science</i> was paleometagenomics (including the Neandertal genome), that managed a short mention in <I>Discover</i>'s number 7 ranked story. I'm bringing this up because <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/site/new_year_predictions_2006.html">I predicted it</a> in my 2006 New Year's predictions. 
</p>

<p>
I'll be reviewing my predictions and making 2007 predictions next week -- right now it looks like I did pretty well on the solid ones, and downright poorly on the speculative ones.
