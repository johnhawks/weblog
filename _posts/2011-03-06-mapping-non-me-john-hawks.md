The <a href="http://names.whitepages.com/John/Hawks">White Pages</a> can do a map showing how many listings there are for any name in the states of the U.S. Here's the map for "John Hawks":

I find this so interesting -- there are dozens of people sharing my name out there. Just look how many not-me John Hawks are in California! I do know of a few of these nominal doppelgangers from Google, but they're just the left end of the internet histogram. It's purely a function of having a common first name, of course, and many surnames are much more common than mine. 

It is amusing to think that someday any one of these folks may be swarmed by pickets of clueless creationists.
