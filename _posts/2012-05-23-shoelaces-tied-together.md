Zen Faulkes comments on last week's National Academies meeting on Science Communication: <a href="http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2012/05/self-defeating-prophecy.html">"Self-defeating prophecy"</a>.

<blockquote>Heres a screenshot of day two of the Sackler colloquia on science communication from the National Academy of Science, where the most diversity you see is in tie colour. (That John Holdren is a wild man. A coloured tie?)</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>I was disappointed that he showed as an example of the current state of the art in science communication. He includes someone who is <strong>dead</strong> (Sagan) and someone who <strong>isnt a scientist</strong> (Gore). Thats our A list team? One, maybe two, living scientists as skilled communicators?
