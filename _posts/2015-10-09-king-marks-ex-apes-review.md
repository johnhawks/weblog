Barbara King discusses Jon Marks' new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520285824/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0520285824&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkId=LOC7LGMDOH4EZLPQ"><em>Tales of the Ex-Apes: How We Think about Human Evolution</em></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=johnhawksanth-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0520285824" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, on her NPR blog: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/10/08/446877747/are-we-ex-apes-a-story-of-human-evolution">"Are We Ex-Apes? A Story Of Human Evolution"</a>. 

<blockquote>That term — ex-apes — get emphasized in the book a lot by Marks, as does "human exceptionalism." Marks <em>really</em> doesn't want to be an ape — and he delivers his argument in a book that's fresh (in all senses of the word), funny and full of rigorous anthropological scholarship. His argument pushes back against my tendency — even while working within the same discipline as Marks's — to emphasize not ape-human boundaries but ape-human continuities.</blockquote>


I make a cameo appearance in the review, in reference to the title, "ex-apes", because I have made a similar argument that humans are not apes but hominoids in one of my most controversial posts of all time (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/phylogeny/taxonomy/humans-arent-apes-2012.html">"Humans aren't monkeys. We aren't apes, either."</a>).
