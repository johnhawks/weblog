Thanks to a reader for pointing out the mention of my work in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/science/23angi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">this Natalie Angier article</a> in the <i>NY Times</i>. It's about variations in human hearing, and references my work on genes related to hearing. I had a couple of inquiries about this; I haven't been writing about it on the blog because the work is still in progress.
