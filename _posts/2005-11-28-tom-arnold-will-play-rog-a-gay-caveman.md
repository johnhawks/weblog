That's the last line of <a href="http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=12105">this news item</a> about the cast of the upcoming movie, "Homo Erectus: A Caveman Comedy": 

<blockquote>The film centers on Ishbo ([Adam] Rifkin), a philosophical caveman who loves Fardart ([Ali] Larter), but she only has eyes for Ishbo's studly, dimwitted brother, Thudnik ([Hayes] MacArthur). [<i>Kill Bill</i>'s David] Carradine and [<i>Rocky</i>'s Talia] Shire will play Ishbo's parents, while [Tom] Arnold will play Rog, a gay caveman.</blockquote>

Hmmm...a philosophical caveman? Would that be like <a href="http://www.creators.com/comics_show.cfm?comicname=bc">Johnny Hart</a>?

The whole thing reminds me of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0082146/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9Y2F2ZW1hbnxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=23;fm=1"><i>Caveman</i></a>, a movie from 1981 where Ringo Starr and Dennis Quaid compete for Shelley Long (!). Man, I thought that movie was great when I was 9! Maybe it made me an anthropologist.... 

OK, I've snapped out of it.
