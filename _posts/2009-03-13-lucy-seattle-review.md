The <i>NY Times</i> has a review of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19bust.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">the Pacific Science Center's Lucy experience</a>, which came to an end this week. They're blaming the financial loss on Obama: 

<blockquote>But the sour economy does not seem to explain all of Lucys troubles. A rare December snowstorm played a role, and Bryce Seidl, the centers president and chief executive, has suggested less intuitive reasons like the feverish focus this liberal city had on the election of President Obama and his transition to office.</blockquote>

Yep. That's gotta be it. Meanwhile, 

<blockquote>This is going to be a big thing, [Ethiopian honorary consul] Mr. Kebede said. Next year, he said, he hopes Lucy will travel to China for an exposition in Shanghai.</blockquote>
