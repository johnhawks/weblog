An excerpt from <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/baby-names2007-pr.htm">a Social Security Agency</a> press release about popular baby names of 2007:
</p>

<blockquote>For reasons likely to puzzle baby name experts around the world, <b>American parents have become infatuated by names, particularly for their sons, that rhyme with the word "maiden."</b> These names for boys include: Jayden (No. 18); Aiden (No. 27); Aidan (No. 54); Jaden (No. 76); Caden (No. 92); Kaden (No. 98); Ayden (No.102); Braden (No.156); Cayden (No.175); Jaiden (No.191); Kaiden (No. 220); Aden (No. 264); Caiden (No. 286); Braeden (No. 325); Braydon (No. 361); Jaydon (No. 415); Jadon (No. 423); Braiden (No. 529); Zayden (No. 588); Jaeden (No. 593); Aydan (No. 598); Bradyn (No. 629); Kadin (No. 657); Jadyn (No. 696); Kaeden (No. 701); Jaydin (No. 757); Braedon (No. 805); Aidyn (No. 818); Haiden (No. 820); Jaidyn (No. 841); Kadyn (No. 878); Jaydan (No. 887); Raiden (No. 931); and Adin (No. 983). This startling trend was present, but less pronounced, with girls names: Jayden (No. 172); Jadyn (No. 319); Jaden (No. 335); Jaiden (No. 429); Kayden (No. 507); and Jaidyn (No. 561). Social Security spokesman Mark Lassiter indicated that the agency would resist any legislative efforts to standardize the spelling of these names.</blockquote>

I remember when we were taking Sophie home from the hospital in 2000, that a duo of new mothers were discussing their babies' names. One was "Jayden," the other "Craydon." Why Craydon? Because "Kayden" was already taken by a cousin!
