A nice article in the May <I>Scientific American</i> by writer Fredric Heeren reviews the new Turkana Basin Institute:
</p>

<blockquote>Researchers now claim to have found a way to collect fossils quickly while motivating the people to protect their heritage, a plan that involves a shift from 10-week field seasons to 50 weeks of fossil collecting annually. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The activity will fall under the aegis of the newly formed Turkana Basin Institute (TBI). Guided by Richard Leakey, his wife Meave and daughter Louise, it has raised $2.1 million to build a permanent field station at Ileret, east of Lake Turkana. Since April 2007, this camp has been transformed from a few tents into a field worker's wish list: a stone lab with plenty of curatorial space, staffed kitchens, metal prefab buildings and a garage with a full-time mechanic. The directors hope that year-round work will accelerate fossil recovery fivefold. Next year a second station will be built on the lake's west side.</blockquote>

<p>
The article goes slightly into some disagreements about the role of the institute and its relationship to ongoing field sites. 
</p>

<p>
The TBI, connected to Stony Brook University has <a href="http://turkanabasin.org/index2.htm">a website</a>, which is very slick-looking -- but its captions sloppily still include Latin filler instead of actual information. I hope they get a discount on the design!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it generally sounds like a good idea. Considering the number of permanent year-round field stations in primatology, it only makes sense to have such a facility for productive paleoanthropological field sites. I only wish there were more field sites that justified the investment!
