<i>Cosmos</i> posts <a href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/3609/full">a long biographical retrospective from Stephen Hawking</a> about his life and work. A lot of it will be review for people well-read on the history of cosmology -- but I hadn't realized this: 

<blockquote>However, two Russians, Lifshitz and Khalatnikov, had claimed to have proved that a general contraction without exact symmetry would always lead to a bounce, with the density remaining finite.

This result was very convenient for Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism because it avoided awkward questions about the creation of the universe. It therefore became an article of faith for Soviet scientists.</blockquote>
