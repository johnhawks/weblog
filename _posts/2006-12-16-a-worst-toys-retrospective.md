<p>
In honor of the season, I ran across <a href="http://www.radarmagazine.com/features/2006/12/toys.php">Radar Magazine's list</a> of 10 dangerous toys from years gone by. 
</p>

<blockquote>Lawn darts were massive weighted spears. You threw them. They stuck where they landed. If they happened to land in your skull, well, then you should have moved.</blockquote>

<p>
Some of the best parts are the comments, where people who actually had the toys have been sounding off. The folks who actually had the "Atomic Energy Lab" as kids are the best!
</p>

<p>
Here's more:
</p>

<blockquote>Some kids had belt buckles. Others had cap guns. Only the lucky ones had the Bat Masterson Derringer Belt Gun, a two-in-one combo that took care of all your pants-securing needs with the option every ten-year-old dreams of: the ability to shoot caps at groin level.</blockquote>

<p>
The whole thing is in questionable taste, which might be just what you need on a December morning.
