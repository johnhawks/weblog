<blockquote>The same genes that give sharks their sixth sense and allow them to detect electrical signals are also responsible for the development of head and facial features in humans, a new study suggests.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The finding supports the idea that the early sea creatures which eventually evolved into humans could also sense electricity before they emerged onto land.</blockquote>

The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.05076.x">paper by Renata Freitas and colleagues</a> is in <i>Evolution and Development</i>. Here is the suggestive part of the discussion: 
</p>

<blockquote>Our finding that the rostral spread of the <i>EphA4</i> expression domain prefigures the routes taken by mechanosensory and electrosensory axons is reminiscent of mouse ear innervation, in which <i>EphA4</i> is expressed in the cells lining the auditory nerve pathway, where it directs axons to the cochlea (Pickles 2003). If this function is conserved in the shark laterosensory system, then <i>EphA4</i> may be involved in guidance of sensory axons to electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors. Indeed, absence of <i>EphA4</i> expression from ampullary placodes may also relate to the termination of growth cones at these positions. This may be important for both function and development of electroreceptors, as it has been suggested that the arrival of nerve fibers may induce formation of electroreceptive organs (although it is also possible that the placodes attract axons; Fritzsch et al. 1998).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Expression of <i>EphA4</i> in the shark laterosensory system may represent a deeply conserved mechanism for establishing topographic maps of peripheral sensory inputs in vertebrates. In the mouse, <i>EphA4</i> and EphrinA5 regulate development of the somatotopic map of projections from sensory whiskers to the barrel fields on the cortex (Vanderhaeghen et al. 2000). <i>EphA4</i> has been shown to regulate thalamocortical projections, as well as the topographic projections of motor neurons from the spinal cord to the limb (Eberhart et al. 2000, 2002). Similar spatial patterning occurs in the auditory system, where topographic projections originating from the cochlea project to the nucleus magnocellularis, which in turn, innervates the nucleus laminaris in the brain to form a tonotopic map of high- to low-frequency sounds. Interestingly, <i>EphA4</i> is expressed in a tonotopic gradient at the time when nucleus magnocellularis axons are forming synapses on the nucleus laminaris (Person et al. 2004). The association between expression of <i>EphA4</i> and development of the shark electrosensory system suggests that <i>EphA4</i> could play a role in establishing the topographic relationships between peripheral electroreceptors and their primary central targets. Regulation of <i>EphA4</i> expression during development of the cephalic electrosensory system would therefore underlie how sharks localize the position of electrical stimuli relative to their spatial map of the body. This hypothesis is consistent with <i>EphA4</i> playing a general role in the establishment of topographic maps during vertebrate embryogenesis (Vanderhaeghen et al. 2000; Yue et al. 2002; Dufour et al. 2003; Person et al. 2004).</blockquote>

This kind of deep genetic homology is not new -- one of the early insights of evo-devo was the widely shared genetic homologies underpinning sight in different lineages who "independently" evolved it. But this is interesting to me because electrosensory organs are easily seen as "exotic" characteristics of some lineages very distant to us. This study suggests that they may have served an important role in the early evolution of tetrapod ancestors. The genes that help generate electroreceptivity in sharks are still expressed in mammals, bent to other purposes.

The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11221101">LiveScience article</a> has an embryological note of caution from Glenn Northcutt, by the way:
</p>

<blockquote>Glenn Northcutt, a neuroscientist at the University of California at San Diego, who was not involved in the study, said the finding was interesting, but that more studies are needed before a direct link between neural crest cells and electroreceptors can be established.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It still requires a definitive experiment, where the developing neural crest cells are marked with dye, the embryo develops and the dye clearly shows up in the electroreceptors," Northcutt said.</blockquote>

<i>Evolution and Development</i> is a really cool journal. Two of the other articles in the same issue relate to the sensory systems of cave fish -- a classic problem in evolution for which evo-devo approaches are giving interesting answers.
