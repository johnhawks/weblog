Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, has <a href="http://ncse.com/news/2013/05/ncses-scott-to-retire-0014832">announced that she will retire by the end of this year</a>. 

<blockquote>"It's a good time to retire, with our new climate change initiative off to a strong start and with the staff energized and excited by the new challenges ahead," she commented. "The person who replaces me will find a strong staff, a strong set of programs, and a strong board of directors."</blockquote>

The NCSE has been central to defending the teaching of evolution in public K-12 schools in the U.S., and provides many free resources for teachers, parents and students. Scott has done a tremendous amount to increase the organization's profile and service. As a former president of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, she has consistently helped to keep human evolution and human biology important parts of NCSE's outreach efforts.
