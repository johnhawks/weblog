Claire Evans <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/universe/2010/03/_ursula_k_leguin_is.php">interviews author Ursula K. LeGuin</a>. It's mostly about LeGuin's outspoken opposition to the Google copyright grab:

<blockquote> Universe: What do you want to happen to your books after you die?</blockquote>

<blockquote>UKL: I want them to be available, I want cheap paper editions of them, I want them to be continuously downloaded in forty different languages, I want them to be read, I want them to be argued about, I want people to cry over them, I want unreadable dissertations written about them, I want people to get angry with them, I want people to love them. </blockquote>

I suppose I have a few readers who don't know that the "K" is for Kroeber, Ursula LeGuin being one of the most accomplished offspring of a famous anthropologist, whose books carry the imprint of that pedigree.
