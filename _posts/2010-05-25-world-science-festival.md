The <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/">World Science Festival</a> will be going on next week in New York City. It's an interesting <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2010/all-events-by-date">lineup of events</a>. 

One thing I noticed: Anthropology must not be festive enough! Looks like you can get your fill of physics, space science, genomics, and psychology, but there's not a lot of biology or evolution.  

One of interest: <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/all-creatures-great-and-smart">"All Creatures Great and Smart"</a> includes Marc Hauser, Brian Hare and Klaus Zuberb&uuml;ler, among others. It seems psychology-oriented, but has that ape cognition angle. There's also a program called <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/brutality-and-the-brain">"Brutality and the Brain"</a> that examines whether humans are violent by nature. 

If you're in the New York area, check out the schedule. You can get your evolution fix at the American Museum of Natural History. 

Although they have <i>way</i> too many species of hominins, too.
