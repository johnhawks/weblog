The rest of this week is Darwin Day  here at the University of Wisconsin. I have a bunch of local readers, and I want to make sure the word is out about all the activities, Thursday through Saturday. Most of the action happens at the brand-new Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, which gives you another reason to come check it out!

We have some incredible speakers coming for these events. And then, there's me, talking on Saturday about Neandertal genetics. In case you're interested in that kind of thing...

From our press release: 

<blockquote>We start Thursday by hosting high school and middle school teachers for a workshop regarding tools for teaching human evolution.  At noon, Alan Love, University of Minnesota, will present a talk entitled, "Darwin's Functional Reasoning, Homology, and the Structure(s) of Evolutionary Theory."  Then we will listen to four short talks with discussions on evolutionary phenomena related to humans, followed that evening by a showing of the 2009 film Creation: The True Story of Charles Darwin.   UW-Madison History of Science Professors Lynn Nyhart and Ron Numbers , along with Alan Love, will lead a panel discussion on the movie.

Friday evening, we will have a short reception before Jill Pruetz gives the keynote talk on savanna chimpanzees.  Dr. Pruetz has worked with chimps and discovered that they not only make tools (spears), but they carry them into battle.  She has won numerous awards for her work and has been featured in National Geographic as a rising scientist.

On Saturday, we will host a variety of interactive exhibits, including our multifaceted Tree of Life. The Tree is especially designed for children of all ages. In addition, John Hawks, UW-Madison, will give us insights into Neanderthals and their genomes.  Karen Rosenberg, University of Delaware, will follow with a discussion of the evolution of the human birth process.  We wrap it all up with a panel discussion.</blockquote>
