W. W. Howells, in the conclusion of the 1980 review, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.1330230503">"<em>Homo erectus</em>--Who, When and Where: A Survey"</a>:

<blockquote>So we might be wise to be continually careful in writing about <em>Homo erectus</em>, making clear whether one is referring to a population or taxon with a workable definition (such as might embrace all the Chou-k'ou-tien and Javanese fossils), or to a grade taken broadly, or to a time zone (Campbell, 1972). The history of argument about the "Neanderthal phase" should show what the problems may be. As to subspecies of <em>H. erectus</em>, there [sic] are of course legitimate and what we should look for; we should expect their development and their survival over considerable periods. There is no reason to suppose that <em>H. erectus</em> as a species did not include all hominids for a long interval. But the bestowing of names, like having a child, carries responsibilities. To be too liberal with subspecific names, even awarding them to single specimens (e.g., <em>H. e. leakeyi</em>), rather than to recognizable populations, is both to injure their use and to confuse the search for real lineages.</blockquote>

I'm quoting Howells not to endorse this view but because he expresses clearly one opinion about the goals of naming species and subspecies.
