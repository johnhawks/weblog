I'm rolling out some new CSS for the site. It was time for a new look, and I've been maintaining a parallel version for a while to work out the kinks. If something looks out of place, try hitting refresh -- browsers sometimes need a little coaxing to update remote CSS links. Nothing has changed but the look, at least not yet.

That's Georgia as the main text font, now, and Lucida Grande as the headline font, replacing Trebuchet.
