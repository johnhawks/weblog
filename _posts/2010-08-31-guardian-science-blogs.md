<i>The Guardian</i> now has a small network of science blogs. Their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media">launch announcement</a> includes this surprising factoid: 

<blockquote>You would not know it from general media coverage but, on the web, science is alive with remarkable debate. According to the Pew Research Centre, science accounts for 10% of all stories on blogs but only 1% of the stories in mainstream media coveage. (The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism looked at a year's news coverage starting from January 2009.)</blockquote>

I'm not sure that science accounts for 10% of stories on <i>science</i> blogs, but the idea is irresistible. Just think if all the effort we spend on grant applications could be directed toward productive work!
