There's <a href="http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070429/070429caveman.html">this quiz</a> from <i>USA Weekend</i> -- that Sunday newspaper insert magazine: 
</p>

<blockquote>What's hotter these days than cavemen and fifth-graders? Geico has hit a home run with its cavemen ads, and the hilariously testy portrayal of early man is now in pilot development for an ABC sitcom. And the Fox game show "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?" is one of the top new series of the season, airing Thursdays through May 10.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both pop-culture sensations work well for the very same reason: We watch with the assumption that we have an intellectual edge over the subjects. But in the end, it's the cavemen and the fifth-graders who demonstrate that they're the ones with the real smarts. So we at USA WEEKEND Magazine thought we'd present a fun quiz that combines the two: "Are You Smarter Than a 5th-Grade Caveman?"</blockquote>

I have nothing more to say. Other than, some paleoanthropologists have been passing this around on e-mail today, and none of us seem to be able to come up with the right answers. Which I suppose is a bad sign. For somebody.
