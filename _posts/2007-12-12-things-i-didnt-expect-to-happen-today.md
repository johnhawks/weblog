<p>
I am absolutely overwhelmed by the interest and press given to our <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/selection/acceleration_embargo_ends_2007.html">paper about acceleration of human evolution</a>. So far, the paper hasn't yet shown up online at <i>PNAS</i>, but you can get a copy here and there, or by asking me for a preprint. 
</p>

<p>
Google News is <a href="http://news.google.com/news?btcid=9ef52c86d6e6c898">tracking 240 stories</a> worldwide on the research as of today, and that link also points to comments by two of my coauthors, Eric Wang and Henry Harpending. 
</p>

<p>
I just wanted to dash down a list of things that have surprised me: 
</p>

<p>
1. I didn't expect to be on the Drudge Report. 
</p>

<p>
2. I didn't expect to be on Rush Limbaugh's stack of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
3. It feels very strange to be on drive-time morning radio shows in Australia. It's like traveling <i>to the world of tomorrow!</i> Because, well, it is.
</p>

<p>
4. A talkative 2-year-old may function as an effective prop when talking to a reporter about the relationship of selection and fertility. 
</p>

<p>
5. I didn't expect to get six inches of snow.
