I admit the sheer amount of wailing had me concerned. And I couldn't at that instant remember how the producers had talked me into this abandoned hotel in the middle of the night. 

What no one really knew until that moment: One twenty-femtosecond burst from my plasma generator would strip the vapor cowl off any roaming spirit that tried to manifest. They thought being undead was bad, wait till they catch the hot breath of Science. 

No pussyfooting around recording lots of backwards audio. This was my new show, <i>Wraith Breakers</i>.
