Today, Science Saturday on <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv">bloggingheads.tv</a> is a conversation between Razib Khan and me. We had a fun conversation about <i>Ardipithecus</i> and the recent study of the population genetics of India.

Here's <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/23155">a non-embedded link</a> to the bloggingheads site

Razib <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/09/same_glasses_edition.php">pointed out</a> the similarity of eyeglasses <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/22740">in our last diavlog</a>.

I think we did pretty well staying on topic in this one, and getting into some paleoanthropology deeper than your average radio interview. 

If you're finding my blog from the bloggingheads site, please look around! My <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/ardipithecus"><i>Ardipithecus</i> topic link</a>. That goes way back, long before the current discoveries, and there are some interesting posts in there, from today's perspective. 

I especially like the two posts about bushes, ladders, and whether <i>Ardipithecus</i> is our direct ancestor or not: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/evolution/bushes_and_ladders/ladder_vs_bush_white_2006.html">"Spacecraft all over the Pliocene"</a>, and <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/anamensis/asa_issie_white_2006.html">"A ladder not a bush?"

Oh, and I almost forgot this 2006 post linking to Tim White's kvetching over the <i>Orrorin</i> femur: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/early_hominids/bipedalism/white_orrorin_opera_2006.html">"<i>Orrorin</i> opera."</a> If you want a background picture of the competitiveness of research in early hominin field paleontology, that's a case worth examining -- or for a broader view, <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/early_hominids/gibbons_first_human_review_2006.html">Ann Gibbons' book, "The First Human,"</a> has many stories as well.
