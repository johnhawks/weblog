John McPhee, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374518734/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0374518734"><i>Annals of the Former World</i></a> (quoted in <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5997/the-art-of-nonfiction-no-3-john-mcphee"><i>The Paris Review</i></a>):

<blockquote>If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time. And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.</blockquote>
