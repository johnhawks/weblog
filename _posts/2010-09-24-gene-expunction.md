So, it's <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/15/study-can-we-tell-our-genes-to-make-us-fat/">a perfectly ordinary story</a> about epigenetics and how the methylation of some genes may be correlated with BMI. But what I don't understand is the headline: 

<blockquote><b>Study: Can We Tell Our Genes to Make Us Fat?</b></blockquote>

YES! That's <i>exactly</i> what I need -- to tell my <i>genes</i> to make me <i>fat</i>. Please tell me more!
