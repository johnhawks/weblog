Noah Snyder-Mackler's continuing series in the <i>NY Times'</i> "Scientist at Work" blog has been providing a journal of his fieldwork on gelada baboons. 

I'll link to <a href="http://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/next-on-the-gelada-bachelorette/">his current entry</a>, which is about male mating competition, but the whole series would be worthwhile for students wanting a picture of primate field biology.
