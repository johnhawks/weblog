<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the-Huma/44846/">This deserves to be read widely</a>, especially this time of year: 

<blockquote><b>Graduate School in the Humanities: Just Don't Go</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>It's hard to tell young people that universities recognize that their idealism and energy  and lack of information  are an exploitable resource. For universities, the impact of graduate programs on the lives of those students is an acceptable externality, like dumping toxins into a river.</blockquote>
