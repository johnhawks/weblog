Alice Dreger discusses her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594206082/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594206082&linkCode=as2&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkId=24ECTZW2IHWL7PB2"><em>Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science</em></a> in _The Scientist_: <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/42262/title/Stirring-the-Pot/">"Stirring the Pot"</a>. 

<blockquote>Three important insights I’ve gained from studying what has happened to scientists whose research has ticked off activists working within social justice movements: (1) If you want to get in trouble, study sex. (2) Anybody who tells you “all publicity is good publicity” has never been accused of genocide. (3) Death threats are rarely grammatically correct. I illustrate each of these lessons in my new book, <em>Galileo’s Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science.</em></blockquote>

Among other recent cases of "hereticism", the book discusses her reporting on Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel.
