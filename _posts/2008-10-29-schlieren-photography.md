The article by Denise Grady in Tuesday's Science NY Times about "Schlieren photography" features this picture, which is as good an advertisement for the flu shot that I've ever seen. 

<div class="middle-picture">
<img src="/graphics/schlieren-cough.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Schlieren photograph of a cough" />
</div>

The picture, and the work, is by Gary Settles, engineering professor at Penn State.
