The <em>New York Times</em> reports on a revival of the agricultural variety: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/dining/drinks/newark-cider-harrison-apple.html">"Finding Lost Apples and Reviving a Beloved Cider"</a>.

<blockquote>Mr. Rosen, the former chief executive of a Manhattan advertising agency that promoted Svedka vodka and Mike’s Hard Lemonade, wants to reintroduce Newark cider, an 18th- and 19th-century alcoholic drink once famously compared to Champagne.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Newark cider was both a point of pride and big business for the region — requested by name, reportedly lauded by George Washington and produced by dozens of Newark-area cideries with acres of orchards. The secret wasn’t a recipe, but the blending of a quartet of superior apples born in the region: Campfield, Poveshon, Granniwinkle and Harrison, the most celebrated of the four.</blockquote>

I'm always inspired by these discoveries of lost varietals, which give us the potential of tasting the foods and drinks of the past, while recovering variation that might be useful or valuable again.
