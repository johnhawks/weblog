A fascinating read in <em>Wired</em> by C. Brandon Ogbunu: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/james-watson-and-scientific-racism/">"James Watson and the insidiousness of scientific racism".

<blockquote>That one person separates me, an African-American computational biologist, from James Watson—Nobel Laureate and mouthpiece of racist opinions—presents a quandary. For years, I have reveled in the powers of DNA, yet one of the people most associated with its discovery has made abhorrent comments about my race. The dilemma raises several questions: How does it feel to be a black scientist who owes much to James Watson in general, and in my case, is linked to his specific pedigree? Is it much ado about nothing, or might the black scientist occupy a special place in modern conversations about scientific racism?</blockquote>

I like the final thought experiment.
