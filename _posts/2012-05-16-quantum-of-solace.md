I just want to point out, on the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/six-generations-of-daughters-from-baby-to-111-year-old-great-great-great-grandmother/">"six generations of daughters" story</a>...

<blockquote>The family has an astonishing six generations of daughters still living.  The matriarch of the family, Mollie Wood, was born in 1901 and just marked her 111th birthday. The youngest addition to the family, Braylin Marie Higgins, was born in March to Woods great, great granddaughter.</blockquote>

...that the baby and the 111 year old share the same fraction of genes as the average European shares with a Neandertal.
