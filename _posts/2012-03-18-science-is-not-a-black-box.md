I was looking through my archives for my notes about George R. Price and his debunking of the famous ESP experiments by Soal. I haven't found them yet. But I did find this passage from a couple years ago that is worth recycling:  <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/ince-software-assurance-open-access-2010.html">"The bugs will out"</a>. 

<blockquote>If someone demonstrated ESP but the experiment wouldn't work without one particular experimenter standing in the room, we would rightly judge that it is not science. Likewise, if no one else can use your computer program, its results aren't science. Simple as that.</blockquote>
