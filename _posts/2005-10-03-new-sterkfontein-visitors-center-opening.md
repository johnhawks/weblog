Several articles in the South African press have covered the opening of the new visitors' center at the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage site. The one with the most detail is <a href="http://www.miningweekly.co.za/min/news/breaking/?show=75022">in the <i>Mining Weekly</i></a>.

The neatest part is the dedication of the center to Phillip Tobias:

<blockquote>The centre was named after Professor Phillip Tobias, who has worked at the caves for about 60 years conducting scientific research on fossils.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor Tobias, who celebrated his 80th birthday on Friday, told BuaNews that there were times when years passed without any fossils being discovered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We just kept optimism and faith," he reminisced. "But there were also times when fossils came pouring like an avalanche." Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa said more than R160-million had been invested in the Sterkfontein area through tourism, among others.</blockquote>
