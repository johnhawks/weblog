John Noble Wilford <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/science/28fossil.html">reports</a> in the <i>NY Times</i> on today's technical comments that challenge various aspects of the interpretation of <i>Ardipithecus</i>. 

Thure Cerling and colleagues <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1185274">argue that Ardi's paleoenvironment was not as wooded</a> as White and colleagues (2009) had claimed. 

Esteban Sarmiento <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1184148">argues that <i>Ardipithecus</i> wasn't a hominin,</a> in part because of its features, in part because the molecular clock places the human-chimpanzee divergence between 3 and 5 million years ago, too young for the genus to be on our lineage. 

I'll write more later on the Sarmiento comment and White and colleagues' reply. For now, I thought I'd point to these initial skeptical takes on the <i>Ardipithecus</i> story. 

Oh, with some pride I'll point out that my readers were appraised of many of these issues the week of the announcement and thereafter. I discussed the molecular clock issue at some length (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/divergence/ardi-and-the-clock-2009.html">"Reviewing the clock, and phylogenomics"</a>), and of course my <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/ardipithecus/ardipithecus-faq-2009.html"><i>Ardipithecus</i> FAQ</a> laid out most of the anatomy</a>. The pelvis got attention in my post <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/ardipithecus/ardipithecus-pelvis-2009.html">"The <i>Ardipithecus</i> pelvis"</a>, where I was the first to detail the shocking absence of <i>Oreopithecus</i> from the published analysis. 

Does this mean that it has taken <i>Science</i> and the <i>NY Times</i> eight months to catch up to a blog? Well, they're doing different things than I do here, so it's not a fair comparison.
