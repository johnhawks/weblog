<i>Slate</i> has an editorial by Farhad Manjoo, featuring the idiocy of people who write crank letters to NPR (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2286927/">"We Listen to NPR Precisely To Avoid This Sort of Stupidity"</a>). Yes, I know some of my readers probably sympathize with the letter writers, plaintive plaints to keep their highbrow high. 

But lo, there at the end of the dyspeptic quote-mine, we find this: 

<blockquote>"You can't mention sports without someone saying, 'Why are you covering sportsit's just a bunch of Neanderthals, it's just a bunch of fascists!' " says NPR sports correspondent (and Slate sports podcast "Hang Up and Listen" panelist) Mike Pesca.</blockquote>

Imagine! I ask you: What kind of quisling would stack Neandertals and fascists in the same breath?
