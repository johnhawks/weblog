Well, now you can have bone rings <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6215702.stm">grown from your own bone tissue</a>:

<blockquote>"I do think it's interesting that I've only been in contact with bone when it's been in my dinner," said Harriet, "So it's intriguing to have my own bone, my own matter objectified in this way and made into something precious and symbolic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Her partner Matt told BBC News: "When you think about it for a while, it's like ivory but more ethical, and the material has never been part of Harriet, just grown from her code taken from her body.</blockquote>
