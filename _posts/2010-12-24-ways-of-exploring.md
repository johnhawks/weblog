Glendon Mellow of the <a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/">Flying Trilobite</a> ruminates on the purposes of scientific art in a guest post at <i>Scientific American</i>: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=scientific-accuracy-in-art-2010-12-21">"Scientific accuracy in art"</a>. Out of the post, I really like his twist on "different ways of knowing": 

<blockquote>I think a "Way of Knowing" is putting the (painterly, Impressionistic) cart before the (fully-3D-rendered, proper lighting and gamma) horse. The purpose, the path, the roadway of science-art is a Way of Exploring.</blockquote>

The reference to Different Ways of Knowing&#153; is one of the most irksome elements of the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/metascience/culture/anthropology-lewis-2009.html">#AAAfail controversy</a>. Mellow's post is completely unrelated, but I like this alternate way of putting together the construction of knowledge.
