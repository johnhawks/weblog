Check out <a href="http://www.stcynic.com/kitzmiller_342.pdf">the judge's opinion</a> if you are interested. <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2005/12/federal-judge-ruled-tuesday-that.html">Ann Althouse cites from the text</a>, including this portion: 
</p>

<blockquote>The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy.</blockquote>

Of course people may support many kinds of public initiatives for religious reasons, and there's nothing wrong with that. But in the case of Intelligent Design, there is no possible justification that is <i>non-religious</i>, except for unalloyed ignorance. Not even lies -- and the Dover trial revealed plenty -- can hide the fact that ID is a religious viewpoint and not science.

I'm keeping Althouse's emphases in the next passage: 
</p>

<blockquote>With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom. Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. Rather, <b>this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board</b>, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. <b>The breathtaking inanity</b> of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting <b>utter waste of monetary and personal resources</b>.</blockquote>
