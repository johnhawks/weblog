<blockquote>Thanks for your post on the Saturn V.  I remember watching the first shuttle
launch, and being surprised at how it jumped off the pad.  I had become used
to the slow Saturn V launches, and forgot how fast these rockets can rise.
If I remember properly, the craft was bolted to the pad, and five second
after ignition, explosives would blow the bolts away, freeing the rocket to
take off.  It was such a thrilling experience to watch.

Take care,</blockquote>

Thanks much; what a wonderful experience!
