<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/09/stunning-videos-of-evolution-in-action/499136/">This is awesome:</a> 

<blockquote>The problem of drug-resistant infections is terrifying but also abstract; by their nature, microbes are invisible to the naked eye, and the process by which they defy our drugs is even harder to visualise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But now you can: just watch that video again. You’re seeing evolution in action. You’re watching living things facing down new challenges, dying, competing, thriving, invading, and adapting—all in a two-minute movie.</blockquote>

An experimental setup in which bacteria colonize progressively more antibiotic-laced environments when they have favorable mutations, all put on video.
