Kathy Weston describes in <i>Science Careers</i> how she came to leave her position as a research scientist in Britain: <a href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2011_02_04/caredit.a1100011">"Falling Off the Ladder: How Not to Succeed in Academia"</a>. It's a powerful dose of self-reflection, and has lessons for young scientists looking to move up the career ladder. 

<blockquote>What could I have done to check my descent into mediocrity? I should have put aside my fears of looking dumb and got on with the networking stuff anyway. And -- very importantly -- I should have found myself a mentor. Every scientist needs someone in a position of power who has faith in his or her abilities, to provide advice and do a bit of trumpet-blowing on his or her behalf. I should have taken more scientific risks, gone for bigger stakes, and thought harder about direction. Finally, I should have followed my instincts and quit my job before it quit me -- but I was hampered by an exaggerated terror of being labeled a failure.</blockquote>

From tenure, she found herself increasingly dissatisfied, partly because her priorities changed, partly because of the treadmill of maintaining a lab. I hope she will write a longer version, I'm sure there are interesting tales.
