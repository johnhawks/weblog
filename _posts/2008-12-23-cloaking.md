"Cloaking" is like the physics version of the hobbits -- catchy name from a fantasy story and fascinating to the press. But there came a time <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2008/12/22/is-it-possible-to-make-a-real-invisibility-cloak">reading "invisibility cloak" stories</a> that I realized, everyone else was thinking of Harry Potter, while I was thinking of Klingons.
