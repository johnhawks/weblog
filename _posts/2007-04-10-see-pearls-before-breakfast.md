Please let me take a moment away from my usual anthropology content to direct your attention to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">this Washington Post story</a>, "Pearls before breakfast," in which the newspaper set up world-famous violinist Joshua Bell in the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station to play for quarters, to see if anyone would notice. 
</p>

<p>
I won't give the story away, but this paragraph about broke my heart: 
</p>

<blockquote>"No. If you love something but choose not to do it professionally, it's not a waste. Because, you know, you still have it. You have it forever."</blockquote>

<p>
It's a long article, and maybe you'll think it's sappy, but I think this is one of the best newspaper stories I've ever read.
