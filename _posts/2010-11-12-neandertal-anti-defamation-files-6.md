From <i>The Simpsons</i>: 

<blockquote>BART: (in front of class, points to Homer in Neandertal costume) Behold, Neanderthal man, our ugliest, stupidest ancestor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(Kids laugh) </blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Come on, missing link, put on a show.</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (growls) (all laugh) </blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Make a fire!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (grunting)</blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Be scared of the fire!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (yelps)</blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Evolve! Evolve!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (grunting) </blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Get religious about a bird you see!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (Points and looks at sky, chattering birdlike) </blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Sprain your ankle and know it's a death sentence!</blockquote>
<blockquote>HOMER: (falls to floor, groaning and panting, kids laugh) </blockquote>
<blockquote>KRABAPPEL: Very good, Bart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>BART: Can I get extra credit for a caveman break dance?</blockquote>
<blockquote>KRABAPPEL: Of course.</blockquote>

Oh, the humanity!
