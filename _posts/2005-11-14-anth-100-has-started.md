<p>
For those of you who aren't students, my section of the very, very large undergraduate lecture course, General Anthropology, has started today. Regular blogging will be a bit light as I get it running this week. New stuff related to the course will be posted on the blog, but predated so it won't show up on the front page.

<p>
For those of you who are students and are finding the weblog for the first time, welcome! Please feel free to look around as much as you like. You can find the course-specific material <a href="weblog/courses/anth_100/">by clicking here</a>. Old Powerpoints for the course are posted here and at Learn@UW. Look over the next few days for readings.
