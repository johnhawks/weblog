<blockquote>"We're going to arm you with Christian Patriot missiles," Ham, 54, recently told the 1,200 adults gathered at Calvary Temple here in northern New Jersey. It was a Friday night, the kickoff of a heavily advertised weekend conference sponsored by Ham's ministry, Answers in Genesis.</blockquote>

There has been a lot of attention this week to the congregations that are observing Darwin Day, as a recognition that evolution and religion are not in conflict.

<p>
The <i>LA Times</i> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-na-creation11feb11,0,1110748.story?coll=la-home-headlines">an article profiling Ken Ham</a>, who would be on the, um, other side of this issue. 
</p>

<blockquote>A former high-school biology teacher, Ham travels the nation training children as young as 5 to challenge science orthodoxy. He doesn't engage in the political and legal fights that have erupted over the teaching of evolution. His strategy is more subtle: He aims to give people who trust the biblical account of creation the confidence to defend their views -- aggressively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He urges students to offer creationist critiques of their textbooks, parents to take on science museum docents, professionals to raise the subject with colleagues. If Ham has done his job well, his acolytes will ask enough pointed questions -- and set forth enough persuasive arguments -- to shake the doctrine of Darwin.</blockquote>

The article reports on one of these training sessions. Here's the part excerpted by <a href="http://althouse.blogspot.com/2006/02/so-who-should-you-always-trust-god-or.html">Ann Althouse</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>Evangelist Ken Ham smiled at the 2,300 elementary students packed into pews, their faces rapt. With dinosaur puppets and silly cartoons, he was training them to reject much of geology, paleontology and evolutionary biology as a sinister tangle of lies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Boys and girls," Ham said. If a teacher so much as mentions evolution, or the Big Bang, or an era when dinosaurs ruled the Earth, "you put your hand up and you say, 'Excuse me, were you there?' Can you remember that?"</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>The children roared their assent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometimes people will answer, 'No, but you weren't there either,' " Ham told them. "Then you say, 'No, I wasn't, but I know someone who was, and I have his book about the history of the world.' " He waved his Bible in the air.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Who's the only one who's always been there?" Ham asked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"God!" the boys and girls shouted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Who's the only one who knows everything?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"God!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"So who should you always trust, God or the scientists?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>The children answered with a thundering: "God!"</blockquote>

<p>
I notice the annual budget of Answers in Genesis ($15 million) is almost enough to sequence the genome of another mammal species -- every one of which shows 3 billion or so marks of evolution.

We need to get more fossils into schools.
