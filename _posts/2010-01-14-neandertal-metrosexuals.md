By popular request from scads of readers: 

<blockquote><b>Was Neanderthal man the original metrosexual? New study suggests he wore make-up</blockquote>

That's in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1242118/Neanderthal-make-discovered-Proof-human-subspecies-half-wits.html"><i>The Daily Mail</i></a>. I actually like the window title even better, which I assume was an older draft of the story's headline: 

<blockquote><b>Neanderthal 'make-up' discovered: Proof the human subspecies were not the 'half-wits'?</b></blockquote>

It's like something from the <i>Onion</i>. The story is more or less reasonable, and I love the quote at the end: 

<blockquote>Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist from the Natural History Museum in London, supported the findings but added that the view of Neanderthals as 'dim-wits' would be hard to change.

He said: 'I agree that these findings help to disprove the view that Neanderthals were dim-witted. It's very difficult to dislodge the brutish image from popular thinking.

'When football fans behave badly, or politicians advocate reactionary views, they are invariably called "Neanderthal", and I can't see the tabloids changing their headlines any time soon.'</blockquote>

Well, let's see how many of those football fans are wearing makeup!
