An <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0,,2285952,00.html">interesting interview</a> with Steven Pinker in the <i>Guardian</i>. Favorite quote: 

<blockquote>There's no escaping the sharpness of Pinker's mind and his ideas, but he's also a very skilful agent provocateur, who understands perfectly how controversy can raise the profile. When the late Stephen Jay Gould - "he was the pontiff of US science who was always on the side of the angels. He even got to fill the slot reserved for intellectuals writing about baseball" - attacked evolutionary psychology as fatuous in the New York Review in 1997, Pinker did himself no harm by being the one to take him on. He says now that the spat was blown out of all proportion by journalists - "they just weren't used to anyone criticising Gould" - but he hasn't always seemed that eager to set the record straight in the past.</blockquote>
