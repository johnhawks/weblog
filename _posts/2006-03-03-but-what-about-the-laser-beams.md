I'm catching up on some blogging, and <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/mech-tech/mg18925416.300.html">this story in <i>New Scientist</i></a> has been sitting on my computer for a couple of days: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Stealth sharks to patrol the high seas</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>IMAGINE getting inside the mind of a shark: swimming silently through the ocean, sensing faint electrical fields, homing in on the trace of a scent, and navigating through the featureless depths for hour after hour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We may soon be able to do just that via electrical probes in the shark's brain. Engineers funded by the US military have created a neural implant designed to enable a shark's brain signals to be manipulated remotely, controlling the animal's movements, and perhaps even decoding what it is feeling.</blockquote>

<p>
Their plan is that making the shark smell phantom odors on the left will cause it to turn left, and vice versa -- sort of a horse-and-carrot approach. It's a trick they have already pulled off with rat whiskers: 
</p>

<blockquote>The team is not the first to attempt to control animals in this way. John Chapin of the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn has used a similar tactic to guide rats through rubble piles (New Scientist, 25 September 2004, p 21). Chapin's implant stimulates a part of the brain that is wired to their whiskers, so the rats instinctively turn toward the tickled side to see what has brushed by. Chapin rewards that response by stimulating a pleasure centre in the rats' brains. Using this reward process, he has trained the rodents to pause for 10 seconds when they smell a target chemical such as RDX, a component of plastic explosives.</blockquote>

<p>
Now, my question is: will the sharks be our allies when the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/when_lab_mice_attack_2005.html">fearless superintelligent carnivorous, and (now) cyber-equipped mice</a> finally escape our control and drive humanity to undersea refugia? Of course, if all these cyber-equipped animals get hooked to the internet, the mice will just turn the sharks against us to foreclose our escape!
</p>

<p>
As I see it, our only hope is that the <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/missing_navy_dolphins_katrina_2005.html">trained dolphin squads</a> are kept implant-free so that they will continue to hew to human command.
