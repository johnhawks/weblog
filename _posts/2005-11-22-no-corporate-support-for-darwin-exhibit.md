Now <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/evolving-into-a-tricky-exhibit/2005/11/21/1132421603091.html">this (Sydney Morning Herald)</a> is just sad: 
</p>

<blockquote>An exhibition celebrating the life of Charles Darwin, which is slated for the National Museum of Australia later this decade, has failed to find a corporate sponsor in the United States because American companies are anxious not to take sides in the heated debate between scientists and fundamentalist Christians over the theory of evolution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The entire $US3 million ($1.7 million) cost of Darwin, which opened at the American Museum of Natural History in New York at the weekend, is instead being borne by wealthy individuals and private donations.</blockquote>

<p>
Seems like a simple calculation, though: who will notice a company and remember their philanthropy -- the grateful museum-goers or a phalanx of anti-evolutionists? 
</p>

<p>
Well, it's still sad:
</p>

<blockquote>The museum will have to depend more heavily upon the profits of its Darwin-related merchandise to finance the cost of staging the exhibition, including a 30-centimetre Darwin doll, Darwin finger puppets and, for $950, a replica of Darwin's ship, the Beagle, made in China and assembled in Vietnam.</blockquote>

<p>
Our educational legacy safeguarded by Darwin finger-puppets. Well, I guess they're a more going business than <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/paley.html">William Paley</a> finger-puppets....
