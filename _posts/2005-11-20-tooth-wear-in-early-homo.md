Discovery News has <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20051114/homocrunch_arc.html">an article</a> summarizing some of Peter Ungar's recent work on tooth anatomy and wear in early <i>Homo</i>. 
</p>

<blockquote>The study suggests <i>Homo habilis</i>, which some researchers have nicknamed "the handy man" because this species made the first known stone tools, was more of a fruit and veg eater than the apparent omnivore <i>Homo erectus</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Teeth for the latter had greater numbers of pits, while handy habilis teeth had more striations suggestive of pulling down on fruit and leaves.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both of the species would probably have focused on high energy-yield, easy-to-consume foods, such as soft fruits when they could get them," Ungar told Discovery News. "The differences between <i>H. habilis</i> and <i>H. erectus</i> suggest that the latter may have focused a bit more on tough foods. They could have been meat, tough tubers or other items."</blockquote>

This is the most-studied dietary transition in human evolution, and it looks like the answers are getting more solid.
