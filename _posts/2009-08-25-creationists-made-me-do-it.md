In last week's <i>Science</i>, a letter from <a href="http://www.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/">biologist Patrick Keeling</a> that's almost <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.325_945b">too good to be true</a>: 

<blockquote><b>Creationists Made Me Do It</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>On that fateful day, all the science students were herded into the school auditorium, where we listened to a long and richly illustrated lecture describing literal creationism. ... Remarkably, I graduated from senior biology having learned only about creationism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It's hard to overestimate the appeal of rebelling against the system to a teenaged boy, and that day marked the beginning of my path to a career in evolutionary biology.</blockquote>

There's more at the link, but I know many readers can't access the journal and it's a letter that deserves sharing.
