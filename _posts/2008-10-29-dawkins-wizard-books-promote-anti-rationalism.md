Richard Dawkins plans to spend his retirement writing a children's book comparing fairy tale explanations with scientific ones, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html">according to an interview</a>. This promises to be the most exciting children's book since <i>The Bobbsey Twins and the Great Santa Claus Lie</i>. 

<blockquote>Prof Dawkins said he wanted to look at the effects of "bringing children up to believe in spells and wizards".</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I think it is anti-scientific  whether that has a pernicious effect, I don't know," he told More4 News.</blockquote>

Well, since he's outlining what <i>would</i> be the topic of a fifteen-year longitudinal study on cognition and reading experiences, I would <i>guess</i> that he'll settle for just waving his arms around and saying "wizards-bad-BAD." Which is pretty much what he did in <i>The God Delusion</i>. 

RichardDawkins.net has <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3278,Interview-with-Richard-Dawkins-on-fairy-tales-and-retirement,Channel-4">video</a> of the interview. 

I disagree with Dawkins' idea, by the way. I think wizard books (and fantasy generally) convey the idea that the <i>social</i> universe is governed by regular rules, even if a <i>physical</i> universe can have different rules than our own. And the very notion that a physical universe might have different rules gives many opportunities to reflect on the nature of physical laws, which are in many cases hardly obvious to human perception. I think we <i>want</i> scientists to be a little bit anti-rational, to think that there might be organizing principles that they can't see with their eyes. 

He also says this: 

<blockquote>"It is evil to describe a child as a Muslim child or a Christian child. I think labelling children is child abuse and I think there is a very heavy issue, for example, about teaching about hell and torturing their minds with hell.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It's a form of child abuse, even worse than physical child abuse. I wouldn't want to teach a young child, a terrifyingly young child, about hell when he dies, as it's as bad as many forms of physical abuse."</blockquote>

...which brings me to mind of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-dawkins4jan04,0,5577883.story">Dawkins' <i>LA Times</i> editorial from last year</a>, in which he <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/social/dawkins_saddam_execution_2006.html">advocated that Saddam Hussein be held for scientific experimentation</a>. 

I'm wondering whether we should be scaring children with Dawkins...
