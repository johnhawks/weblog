Norwegian scientists are <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20696954/">digging her up</a> for DNA testing: 
</p>

<blockquote>SLAGEN, Norway - Archaeologists exhumed the body of a Viking queen on Monday, hoping to solve a riddle about whether a woman buried with her 1,200 years ago was a servant killed to be a companion into the afterlife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a less gruesome alternative, the two women in the grass-covered Oseberg mound in south Norway might be a royal mother and daughter who died of the same disease and were buried together in 834.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We will do DNA tests to try to find out. I don't know of any Viking skeletons that have been analyzed as we plan to do," Egil Mikkelsen, director of Oslo's Museum of Cultural History, told Reuters at the graveside.</blockquote>

<p>
Well, it's a pretty trivial question for genetics. Here's a more interesting one: Assuming it's not her daughter, which woman is more genetically similar to living Norwegians? They may be digging up kings and queens all over Europe to answer that one...

If you knock, leave them an offering:

<blockquote>The archaeologists placed a Norwegian 20-crown coin - dated 2007 and with a picture of the prow of the Oseberg ship on one side - in the sarcophagus to show any future generations when the grave had been disturbed.</blockquote>

Admit it: if you were digging up a ninth-century grave and found a coin from 1653, it would <i>freak you out!</i> Maybe future archaeologists will just assume this is one of those early twenty-first century "natural" burials.
