<em>Homo erectus</em> entered Asia as early as 1.8 million years ago. One of the earliest specimens of the species is the Modjokerto skull, from Java. The spread of this species across the tropical Old World was a major event in our evolution. After <em>Homo erectus</em> reached East and Southeast Asia, it had a long history &mdash; up to 200,000 years ago or even more recently. 


This station has several representatives of this Asian dispersal of early humans. 

<ul>
<li>Trinil 2, Java, 1.2 million years old.</li>
<li>Sangiran 2, Java, 1.0 million years old.</li>
<li>Zhoukoudian L2, China, 700,000 years old.</li>
<li>Zhoukoudian L1, China, 700,000 years old.</li>
<li>Ngandong 10, Java, 200,000 years old.</li>
<li>Ngandong 8, Java, 200,000 years old.</li>
<li>Nganding 4, Java, 200,000 years old.</li>

</ul>



<strong>What to do:</strong> Overall, these fossils are very similar. However, they come from a wide range of times. Make an attempt to <strong>seriate</strong> the fossils by cranial size. List the results of your seriation. Does it correlate with time? 



Try seriating the skulls according to the form of their frontal bone or supraorbital torus. This feature differs between fossil specimens from Java and China. Does your seriation indicate this difference in geography?
