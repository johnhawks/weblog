From satirical site <i>Glossy News</i>: <a href="http://glossynews.com/society/health/201103211109/painting-of-big-mac-found-in-neanderthal-cave/">"Painting of Big Mac Found in Neanderthal Cave"</a>. 

<blockquote>What is most striking about this painting, says Bouisquet, is that this is precisely the time period during which Neanderthals went extinct. One naturally wonders, Could the consumption of fast food have contributed to the extinction? As yet we simply dont know.</blockquote>
