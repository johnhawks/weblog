An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17conv.html">interview with physicist Eric Mazur</a> in the <i>NY Times</i> hits some interesting points on teaching methods in science: 
</p>

<blockquote><b>Q.</b> <i>Perhaps this concept-based test was flawed?</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>A.</b> No. But it was different. It measured their knowledge of physics forces in daily life. If they'd really understood Newtonian mechanics, they would have aced it. One student asked me: "How should I answer these questions? According to what you taught me? Or according to the way I usually think about these things?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>That was the moment I fell out of my ivory tower. It was then that I began to consider new ways of teaching.</blockquote>

<p>
He gives a brief description of his problem-based teaching methods -- some parts obvious, other parts less so -- and its unexpected results. 
</p>

<blockquote>Just for the fun of it, we once put a silicon wafer into some gas we had lying around the lab. We then irradiated it with ultra-short laser pulses. What came out was a wafer as black as the blackest velvet....And today, we have a patent for this black silicon, which has important applications in communications and sensor technology.</blockquote>

<p>
Teaching genetics is a lot like teaching physics, without the lasers. So the idea of problem-based teaching is very appealing.

The trouble is choreographing a large class of students and managing the results. Mazur has his small groups enter answers into the computer, cutting down on the necessity for him to supervise the results.
