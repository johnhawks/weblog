In this laboratory exercise, you will work to uncover the identity of a hominin fossil. 

The assignment is quite simple: Your TA will give you a fossil cast to work with. Use what you are learning about the morphology of fossil hominins to determine which species or population may have left the evidence you have. 

This exercise will recur each week in labs 5-7 and you will share your analysis of the evidence on the week of lab 8. As you come each week, think about those parts of the fossil record that can be compared to your mystery fossil. Document each species that you encounter. There is a correct answer, and you will be able to determine it from the anatomy in comparison with other specimens in the lab.
