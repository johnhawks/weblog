Holly Dunsworth, whom readers will remember from <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/biotech/testing/genotyping-the-intro-class-2012.html">my previous links to her work in genetics education</a>, recounts a personal experience to show how the "incidentalome" isn't a particularly genetic issue: <a href="http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/2012/11/area-doctor-shatters-area-girls-dream.html">"Area Doctor Shatters Area Girl's Dream of Being Taller Than She Is. (A personal genomics parable)"</a>. 

<blockquote>"He said it so cavalierly, too," said Dunsworth. "I spent my whole life wondering how tall I'd grow to be, hoping and wishing I'd grow to be tall enough to really dominate on the basketball court. And my doctor didn't even warn me that he was about to deliver this dream-killing news, and he definitely didn't ask me if I even wanted to hear it in the first place."</blockquote>

It's all in the metaphyses, you see.
