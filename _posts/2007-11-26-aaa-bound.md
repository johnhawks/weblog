<p>
I'm going to be at the American Anthropological Association meetings this week, from Wednesday evening to Saturday morning. Maybe you'll see me!
</p>

<p>
I'll be giving a talk in Thursday's symposium in honor of my graduate advisor, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wolpoff/">Milford Wolpoff</a>. The symposium runs from 1:45 to 5:30 on Thursday, and I'm scheduled about half-way through. The lineup includes some real stars of paleoanthropology, and it's sure to be the most interesting paleoanthropological stuff at the meetings:
