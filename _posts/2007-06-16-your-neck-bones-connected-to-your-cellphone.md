That was just too precious, in <a href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19426087.600-bones-could-allow-data-swap-via-handshake.html">this <i>New Scientist</i> story</a> about research into making your skeleton a sound-transmitting data bus: 
</p>

<blockquote>Bone is known to be a great conductor of sound, but so far it has only been used to transmit analogue signals in applications such as checking how bone is healing after a fracture, and in hearing aids that transmit sound from outside the skull to the auditory nerve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To see if bone could transmit digital signals over longer distances - to a headset, say, from a sensor worn on the wrist - the team applied a small vibrator to various parts of the body....</blockquote>

<blockquote>...They found the skeleton conducted even low-power vibrations from one location to another with surprisingly few errors. "This is quite amazing because all the links involved multiple bones and many joints," [Lin] Zhong told a conference on body networks in Florence, Italy, this week.</blockquote>

<p>
They go on to suggest that data could be transferred between "body networks" by a firm handshake. Well, I suppose <i>some</i> data already are...
