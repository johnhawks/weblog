I really like that quote, by computer security expert Bruce Schneier. <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63609,humans-not-evolved-for-it-security.aspx">The context</a>, though, is sort of silly:
</p>

<blockquote>He told delegates at the 2007 RSA Conference that there is a gap between the reality of security and the emotional feel of security due to the way our brains have evolved. This leads to people making bad choices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a species we got really good at estimating risk in an East African village 100,000 years ago. But in 2007 London? Modern times are harder."</blockquote>

<p>
Uhh...so it seems to me if you <i>really</i> believed that, you would advocate  computers that properly trigger our anachronistic system of risk detection. Like maybe they could give a leopard-like screech when we choose a password of less than six letters?
</p>

<p>
Or, uhh...maybe you could just <i>make them secure in the first place?</i>

<p>
Still, it's interesting to see this idea about human evolution spreading around out there through the world. The "anachronistic brain": 
</p>

<blockquote>"The brain is still in beta mode, it's got all sorts of patches and workarounds. It's not perfectly created, it's clearly evolved up."</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft">cruft</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Schneier emphasizes our inaccurate assessments of small risks, proposing that we did much better in our "natural" habitat. I'm not so sure about that -- remember, I'm running a <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/minds/risk/seat_belt_risk_adams_2006.html">slow-moving series on risk</a>. There's no particular reason to think that our assessments of <i>ancient</i> risks should have been accurate, since <i>accurate</i> risk assessment is not the same as <i>fitness-maximizing</i> risk assessment. 
</p>

<p>
Translate that into the modern environment: Schneier seems to be claiming that the main feature of the modern risk environment is very slight, impersonal, uncontrollable risk margins. Sounds like the flip side of profit-taking opportunities. Maybe we'll evolve safer computers yet.
