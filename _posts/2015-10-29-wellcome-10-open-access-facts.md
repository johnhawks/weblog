The Wellcome Trust blog has a post celebrating 10 years of the Trust's mandatory open access publication policy, with 10 facts about the impact of its open access investment over the years: <a href="http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/10/22/10-years-of-open-access-at-the-wellcome-trust-in-10-numbers/">"10 years of Open Access at the Wellcome Trust in 10 numbers"</a>. 

Wellcome is one of the three key funders of the open access journal <em>eLife</em>, so our publication on <em>Homo naledi</em> made the list!

<blockquote>In September 2015 eLife – the open access journal supported by the Wellcome Trust, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Max Planck Society – published research about a previously-unknown species of extinct hominin. In the first two days following publication this article was viewed over 100,000 times.</blockquote>

Since those first two days, the readers have steadily increased. Over October between 500 and 1000 readers a day have found our description paper, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09560">"<em>Homo naledi</em>, a new species of the genus <em>Homo</em> from the Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa"</a>, and to date more than 230,000 people have viewed it. 

Additionally, more than 81,000 people have viewed our paper describing the geological context of the Dinaledi Chamber, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09561">"Geological and taphonomic context for the new hominin species Homo naledi from the Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa"</a>, and Chris Stringer's <em>eLife</em> commentary on the discovery, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10627">"The many mysteries of <em>Homo naledi</em>"</a> has been viewed more than 33,000 times.
