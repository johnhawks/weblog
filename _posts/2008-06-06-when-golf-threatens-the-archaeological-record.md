 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.320.5881.1273a">This seems bad</a>: 

<blockquote>Wastewater runoff from a golf-course irrigation system is threatening research at caves along South Africa's southern coast that contain the earliest evidence of humans exploiting marine resources, scientists say. To their disappointment, a judge here declined last week to issue an injunction designed to protect the archaeological site.</blockquote>

Water is leaching down through the rock into the caves, including Pinnacle Point (which I <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/links/links_07_10_29.html">wrote about here</a>). The leaching is obviously not good, because it mucks up the chemistry in the sediments, and the sheer presence of extra water may screw with the dating models.
