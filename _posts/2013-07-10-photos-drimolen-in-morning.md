This morning began early with a drive out to the Cradle of Humankind. Colin Menter and Andy Herries were really kind to allow us to visit their excavation at Drimolen, which is a stunning site with a lot of continuing potential for new discoveries. 

Here's a view of the rim of the cave, as it is today:

That's just the top, where the light is hitting the rock, the fossil-bearing sediments and breccias are not in the picture. 

Here you can see more of the site, with the team already busily at work, excavating there in the shadows:

Drimolen has produced some beautiful published remains of <em>Australopithecus robustus</em>, including most of a cranium (DNH 7), and some published teeth of early <em>Homo</em>. Such a wonderful place, and great to hear the story of the site more fully.
