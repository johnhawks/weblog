So...yesterday I posted a link and commentary on a new paper showing Stephen Jay Gould had seriously erred in his argument that Samuel Morton's data were fudged (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/gould-morton-lewis-2011.html">"Gould's 'Unconscious Manipulation of Data'"</a>). I've had a huge positive response to that post, thank everyone for your kind thoughts. 

Within a half hour of posting that from here in Denmark, my family in Wisconsin were taking shelter in the basement as an EF-1 tornado passed over the house. For non-storm-savvy readers, that's the <i>smallest</i> kind of tornado, but as you'll see, still incredibly destructive. Everyone is OK, but pretty shaken-up. 

The storm uprooted our 60-foot silver maple, completely destroying the garage.

Gretchen was on the local news last night. Many trees were down all over town, but fortunately none with quite such a devastating impact:

The house is basically OK but suffered some roof and gutter damage. Hopefully we'll have power back soon. I'll be glad to get home tomorrow.
