I have heard from a number of Canadian readers who wondered whether they could use my Amazon affiliate links. I didn't fully understand the localization -- as Amazon keeps opening new Kindle stores around the world, this is changing the way I end up shopping through them. 

At any rate, I now have <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/?_encoding=UTF8&tag=johnhawkswebl-20">affiliate status with Amazon.ca</a> as well as my classic U.S. and U.K. links. I'll look into more countries also, but for now I'm just happy I've got this working properly. A click on the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/?_encoding=UTF8&tag=johnhawkswebl-20">Canadian Amazon links</a> puts you right out to the right place.
