British wine guru, Oz Clarke, of <i>Top Gear</i>-head James May as he teaches him how to judge wine and squash grapes:

<blockquote>Time to show the wine Neandertal how it's done.</blockquote>

Now, I think there's a more than decent chance that a Neandertal would be the ultimate sommelier. Humans have a whole raft of olfactory receptors that have been deactivated during our evolution, and some people have functional olfactory receptor genes that other human lack. I'd say going to Neandertals, we're likely to find that they have more functional olfactory receptors than most living people. "Wine Neandertal" could be a real compliment, in other words.
