According to the <i>Telegraph</i> (UK), <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/3867382/Neanderthals-could-have-died-out-because-their-bodies-overheated.html">Neandertals became extinct because their mitochondria leaked excess heat</a>: 

<blockquote>Professor Patrick Chinnery, a neurogeneticist at Newcastle University, believes the differences in this mitochondrial DNA could have caused Neanderthals to be inefficient at producing energy, meaning their cells leaked heat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He said: "The question is why did Neanderthals disappear? There are lots of explanations to do with changes in climate and the food supply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Differences in these mitochondrial DNA sequences might explain why modern humans were able to survive while Neanderthals were not.</blockquote>

So, is it true? Did Neandertals go panting into that long good night? 

Well, Siberians <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/ruiz-pesini_selection_mtdna_2004.html">may have mtDNA alleles that leak extra heat</a>, and they're not extinct. It seems like a good idea if you don't live in the tropics and have enough food. Because it's not like Europeans lack opportunities to <i>take off a layer</i> to deal with the heat. 

Plus, as the Neandertal morphology waned in Europe, the climate was getting colder, not warmer. 

The real mistake here is assuming that the mtDNA necessarily <i>shared the same fate</i> as the rest of the genome. Sure, there aren't any living members of the Neandertal mtDNA clade, at least that we know of. But that suggests <i>selection</i> favoring human mtDNA, not necessarily Neandertal extinction. The idea of selection <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/green-2008-complete-mtdna-sequence.html">is supported by the finding of functional variations between human and Neandertal <i>COX2</i></a>, which I discussed in August.

The current research seems like it probably adds detail to this comparison, but that's not an argument for Neandertals going extinct in the heat.
