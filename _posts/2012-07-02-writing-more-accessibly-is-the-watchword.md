Rachel Toor writes in the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> in favor of academics finding a more polished approach to their prose: <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Becoming-a-Stylish-Writer/132677/">"Becoming a stylish writer"</a>. 

<blockquote>In an essay called "Professional Boredom," William Cronon, president of the American Historical Association, warned that, when taken to an extreme, the values and practices of good historyrigorous, complex, and nuanced argumentation; accuracy; grounding in primary research; awareness of the fieldcan make the discipline accessible to only a small group. He warns about writing that keeps readers out rather than inviting them in. He chides against using jargon, and gives these examples: "agency," "contingency," and "document." Quaint, right? I wish I remembered the days when I thought those words counted as academic cant. Cronon suggests that his peers tell stories, and he cautions them not to be boring.</blockquote>

It's not too difficult to make your writing more interesting and accessible for readers, you just need to practice. The Old Guard will resist. I myself have tried to place academic papers where the editor has told me they are written too accessibly -- "like an article from [redacted] magazine". 

Good luck with that attitude!
