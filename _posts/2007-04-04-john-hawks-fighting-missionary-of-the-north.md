That text reads:
</p>

<blockquote>The rugged stretches of the great Northwest were a spawning ground where the worst in men too often came out... and through this wild, dangerous territory roamed John Hawks, Sky Pilot,  a man who quoted from the scriptures... and backed his words with muscles of steel, to guarantee that evil doers heeded them...</blockquote>
