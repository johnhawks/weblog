Here's a nice article about two archaeologists, Gayle Fritz and David Freidel, and their efforts to better educate the public and their students about critical thinking. <a href="http://ampersand.wustl.edu/archaeological-fantasies-and-hoaxes">"Archaeological Fantasies and Hoaxes"</a> presents a list of five big myths and why they are so pervasive in American culture.

The article touches on many valuable points. Here's something I didn't know:

<blockquote>“Incidentally, the opening scene shows Indiana Jones grabbing a golden idol off the altar,” Freidel says. “That’s actually a real jade artifact in the Dumbarton Oaks research library in Washington D.C., and it’s an image of the Aztec goddess Tlazolteotl. It’s a real piece of work, but it’s also an unprovenanced piece of work that was not found in good archaeological context. It was looted.”</blockquote>


When it comes to big public misconceptions, I'm not saying the biggest is aliens, but...
