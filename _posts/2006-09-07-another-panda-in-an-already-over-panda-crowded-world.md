You may have heard how I feel <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/conservation/panda_zoo_licensing_fees_2006.html">about pandas</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>YESSSS! At last there is hope! I am so tired of having to hear about it every time a panda ovulates in this country!</blockquote>

<p>
I'm reminded today that there are only two ways that a zoo can get in the national news -- either <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14706405/">have a panda baby</a>, or engineer a gorilla attack  (<a href="http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_220213458.html">Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,211943,00.html">Boston</a> and <a href="http://www.nbc5i.com/news/2933762/detail.html">Dallas</a>). Oh, and then there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Wheels-Gorilla-Attack-Track/dp/B0007V633U">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFLsrneRcjI">this</a>...
