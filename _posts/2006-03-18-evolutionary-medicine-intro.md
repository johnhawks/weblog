I ran across <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~rjh9u/darwmed.html">an HTML version of an article by Lori Oliwenstein</a>, originally from <i>Discover</i>, that introduces evolutionary medicine. It's a good link for my students, and for anybody else who's interested. And it has a great Paul Ewald quote:
</p>

<blockquote>"You're doing to these organisms what we did to wolves," says Ewald. "Wolves were dangerous to us, we domesticated them into dogs, and then they helped us, they warned us against the wolves that were out there ready to take our babies. And by doing that, we've essentially turned what was a harmful organism into a helplful organism. That's the same thing we did with diphtheria; we took an organism that was causing harm, and without knowing it, we domesticated it into an organism that is protecting us against harmful ones."</blockquote>
