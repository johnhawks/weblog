On November 11, NOVA will present a new hour-long documentary on the hobbits, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hobbit/">briefly described at the PBS website</a>: 

<blockquote>NOVA presents exclusive coverage of new excavations that experts undertook in the summer of 2007 at the site of Ling Bua on the island of Flores, Indonesia. These are the first investigations of the cave site since the sensational discovery of tiny and mysterious human fossil bones at the site in 2004. NOVA will investigate the furious scientific debate that continues to rage on what these "hobbit" bones represent. Are they fossils of a previously unknown primitive branch of the human family? Or are they remains of a dwarf race of modern humans suffering from a strange pathological condition?</blockquote>

The website associated with the show will launch November 7.
