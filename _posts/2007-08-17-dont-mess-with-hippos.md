They kill more people in Africa than any predator, and now they're <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20325403/">hitting the capybaras</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>GULF BREEZE, Fla. - A Capybara at a Florida Panhandle zoo died after it was attacked by an adult hippopotamus, zoo officials said Thursday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Capybara, a large aquatic rodent, died last week at The Zoo Northwest Florida, just a month after a baby hippo was fatally attacked by an adult hippo.</blockquote>

<p>
Fortunately, they're not nearly as dangerous in zoos as <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/humor/ape_restaurant_rampages_2007.w">gorillas</a>. I guess they shouldn't assume the giant rodents can look out for themselves, though.
