Kate Clancy writes <a href="http://jezebel.com/#!5769285">"Why Im An Activist Scientist For Womens Health"</a>, covers her research, some of the public impact of understanding women's health issues, and how important it is to share the process of science with the public: 


<blockquote>At the end of the day, scientists are passionate about their science, and the public would benefit immensely from having access to that passion and that information. In this Internet age where you can search for just about anything, you cannot always filter out the noise and pseudoscience. When more scientists consider themselves activist scientists, and understand their duty to communicate the work that they do, we will have a better-informed and more appreciative public. That's good for women's health, and good for my science.</blockquote>
