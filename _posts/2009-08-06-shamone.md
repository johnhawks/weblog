Funny, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/1701262,CST-NWS-sneed05.article">this didn't stand out to me</a> at the Field when we were there last...

<blockquote>It's eerie, and it's creepy: An ancient limestone Egyptian bust in the Field Museum is a dead bang look-a-like of singer Michael Jackson.</blockquote>

Uh...wait for it...

<blockquote>The curiosity: The nose of the ancient Egyptian statue, which has been in the museum's private collection since 1899, is disintegrating. At the end of his life, Jackson's nose appeared to be disintegrating.</blockquote>

It does look weirdly like Michael Jackson. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/08/michael_jacksons_face_in_an_an.html">A larger picture from NPR</a>)
