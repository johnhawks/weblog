<p>
Writer John Scalzi <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/005181.html">takes note</a> of the fact that he's right in the neighborhood of the Creation Museum, and now <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/005182.html">offers</a> to write a full, "snarkilicious" report if his readers come up with $250 for his PayPal account in the next week. If you like his books, you might want to contribute.

I imagine he'll get there, so it should be fun.
