<i>Nature</i> has Martin Kemp review an art exhibition by Walton Ford (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/467158a">"Monkey business"</a>), of interest because of the fine watercolor depictions of animals -- reminiscent of 19th century illustration -- in anthropomorphic contexts. I'm pointing to it because I like the art, which has been described as "Audubon on Viagra". PBS has a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/ford/index.html">nice online profile</a> of Ford.
