Worth reading from last week if you haven't seen it: <i>The Right Stuff</i> author Tom Wolfe's lament on NASA's unfulfilled promise, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/opinion/19wolfe.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all">"One Giant Leap to Nowhere"</a>. Most tragic part: Wolfe's account of the Canaveral tour bus operator:

<blockquote>Sure enough, it turned out he had not been put on Earth for this job. He was an engineer who until recently had been a NASA heat-shield specialist. A baffling wave of layoffs had begun, and his job was eliminated. It was so bad he was lucky to have gotten this stand-up Spielmeister gig on a tour bus. Neil Armstrong and his two crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, were still on their triumphal world tour ... while back home, NASAs irreplaceable team of highly motivated space scientists  irreplaceable!  there were no others! ...anywhere! ... You couldnt just run an ad saying, Help Wanted: Experienced heat-shield expert ... the irreplaceable team was breaking up, scattering in nobody knows how many hopeless directions.</blockquote>
