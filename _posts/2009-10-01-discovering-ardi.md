UPDATE (2009-10-22): I wrote this post before the film premiered, but it's gotten a lot of Google traffic. My <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/tv/discovering-ardi-bipedalism-2009.html">notes on watching the film</a> might be more interesting. I haven't yet gotten to see the whole thing, but together with some correspondents, I think I've put together some useful notes. 

ORIGINAL POST (2009-10-01):

OK, so if you thought <i>Ardipithecus</i> was going to be different from the <i>Darwinius</i> media fiasco... <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/ardipithecus/about/about.html">this one is for you</a>: 

<blockquote> A DISCOVERY CHANNEL EXCLUSIVE, WORLD PREMIERE SPECIAL
BRINGS YOU THE STORY OF THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT HUMAN EVOLUTION</blockquote>

<blockquote>DISCOVERING ARDI airs Sunday, October 11 at 9 PM (ET/PT)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Following publication in the journal Science on the discovery and study of a 4.4 million-year-old female partial skeleton nicknamed "Ardi," Discovery Channel will present a world premiere special, DISCOVERING ARDI, Sunday October 11 at 9 PM (ET/PT) documenting the sustained, intensive investigation leading up to this landmark publication of the Ardipithecus ramidus fossils.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>"The novel anatomy that we describe in these papers fundamentally alters our understanding of human origins and early evolution,"</b> said project anatomist and evolutionary biologist, Professor C. Owen Lovejoy, Kent State University. 

Project co-director and paleontologist Professor Tim White of the Human Evolution Research Center at the University of California Berkeley adds, <b>"<i>Ardipithecus</i> is not a chimp. It's not a human. It's what we used to be."</b>
</blockquote>

Oh, my. Well it stands to reason that something this coordinated wasn't just science. I wonder whether anyone will ask the questions about the timing of <i>Science's</i> publication and the documentary release only a week later. 

I have to tell you, I've been wondering about all the bogus-looking Darwin paraphrases these guys have been throwing out -- you know, the ones about how Darwin taught us about how chimpanzees changed from their common ancestors, and how fossil humans would tell us about the apes. I can't find anything like that in any of Darwin's publications -- please e-mail if it's there and I'm missing it. 

But now I see where they're coming from. It's the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/ardipithecus/ardipithecus.html">tagline from the Discovery show!</a>

<blockquote><b>DISCOVERING ARDI</b></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>DARWIN COULD ONLY DREAM OF FINDING THIS</i></blockquote>

Really? I'm <i>soooooo</i> tempted to make that the blog's tagline right now.... OOOH OOOH, better yet -- 

<blockquote><i>DARWIN COULD ONLY DREAM OF BEING THIS HANDSOME</i></blockquote>
