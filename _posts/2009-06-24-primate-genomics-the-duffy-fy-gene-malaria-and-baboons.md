Jenny Tung of Duke University and colleagues report in <i>Nature</i> (online early) that yellow baboons have evolved a Duffy antigen-related defense against a baboon relative of malaria. 

Most Africans carry a null allele for the Duffy antigen, coded by the <i>DARC</i> gene, which functions to protect them from <i>vivax</i> malaria. It's not the worst kind of malaria (that would be <I>falciparum</i>), but it is a major cause of disease outside those regions where the Fy*O allele is near fixation. 

The baboon version of <i>DARC</i> is not convergent with the human null allele; the paper reports that it actually increases the gene activity, whereas the baboon variant allele actually increases the activity. 

Presumably, the different defense in baboons is because they're fighting a different parasite: 

<blockquote>Baboons are not generally infected by <i>Plasmodium</i> in the wild, but are vulnerable to infection by several closely related haematoprotozoans (4, 5) including <i>Hepatocystis kochi</i>, a blood parasite nested within the paraphyletic <i>Plasmodium</i> genus (15). <i>Hepatocystis</i> parasites do not produce the cyclical fever spikes typical of malaria in humans, but do produce anaemia and visible merocyst formation, followed by scarring on the liver (4).</blockquote>

They were able to show that the infection rate with <i>Hepatocystis</i> is significantly lower in baboons that cary the protective allele. 

Based on their comparisons, the locus looks like a case of balancing selection: 

<blockquote>We detected an increased level of population differentiation among East African baboon populations around <i>FY</i>, by comparing a <i>FY</i>-linked microsatellite with 35 neutral microsatellites (<i>F</i><sub>st</sub> = 0.31, P<0.029; range of <i>F</i><sub>st</sub> for the neutral markers was 0.0080.346; <i>F</i><sub>st</sub> is a metric describing genetic divergence between populations based on allele frequency differences at variable sites; Supplementary Fig. 3). We also detected a higher value for the Tajima's <i>D</i> statistic (<i>D</i> = 1.26) in this region relative to nine of nine other resequenced putative cis-regulatory regions in the Amboseli population and 11 of 12 resequenced transcribed regions (range of <i>D</i> for all other loci was -1.60 to 2.12). The only locus with a higher value of <i>D</i>, a transcribed portion of the gene <i>MSR1</i>, exhibited an even more extreme value than that identified for the <i>MHC</i> <i>DQA1</i> promoter in baboons (22), which is known to evolve under strong trans-specific balancing selection (20).</blockquote>

A balance really would be necessary for them to be likely to have any evidence of selection. There's no reason to think that baboons are in the kind of demographic and disease transient that humans are in, so if a protective allele were always beneficial, it would likely be fixed. Still, it's not obvious what the <i>disadvantage</i> of the protective allele would be, although in humans it has been suggested that altering Duffy expression may impair immune response by reducing white blood cell count (Reich et al. 2009). Considering the high stress and cortisol levels of wild baboons, it may be that changes in immune activity have even more disadvantages. 


One important aspect of the study is that the allele affects the <i>cis</i>-regulatory region of the gene; that's the general research topic covered by Gregory Wray's research group. I think that it's important because it raises the prospect that targeted sequencing of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in primate genomes might lead to the discovery of more adaptive variations within primate species. In their concluding paragraph, the authors emphasize the strengths of a combined field and <i>in vitro</i> approach to characterizing functional variants: 

<blockquote><i>In vivo</i> gene expression measurements are complicated by variation in genetic background and in the environment, both of which can modify functional <i>cis</i>-regulatory effects (25, 26). Indeed, our results show that even baboons that are homozygotes at the C/T site sometimes exhibit allelic imbalance in <i>FY</i> expression, suggesting that other, unidentified functional <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants are also segregating in the population. In contrast, in the <i>in vitro</i> comparisons, only a single <i>cis</i>-regulatory site differed between the experimental constructs, thus controlling for both environment and genetic backgrounds. Using both approaches in tandem can be synergistic: while <i>in vitro</i> experiments can help pin down specific functional sites, <i>in vivo</i> results demonstrate that these effects are relevant to the biology of individuals in the wild.</blockquote>

When it comes to primate genetics, looking for defenses to infectious diseases should be low-hanging fruit. Just take human genes that have alleles that defend against diseases, and sequence them for variations. Hopefully we'll find many others -- and in a few cases, those variations may prove useful in human health contexts, as they may reveal new pathways to deter or defeat pathogen infections.
