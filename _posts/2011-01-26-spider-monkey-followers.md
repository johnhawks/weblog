Anthony Di Fiore writes in the <i>NY Times</i> "Notes from the field" feature about his work with spider monkeys in Ecuador: <a href="http://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/spider-monkey-fathers-and-sons/">"Spider monkey fathers and sons"</a>. 

<blockquote>One trick weve learned for locating samples is to listen for the buzz of a shiny emerald dung beetle, since they often find a fresh sample within a few moments of it hitting the ground. Conveniently, the dung beetles sometimes roll up a nice bolus of poop, kicking out embedded seeds, which we then shamelessly steal.</blockquote>
