The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) is a science-focused high school. They have <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ncssm/albums/72157634582373346">put on Flickr</a> a large series of Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA-NC) licensed photos of their cast collection, including skulls of many hominins. I find it awesome to see a public high school taking this initiative, and I really appreciate the work behind this. Here's a photo of the old Hadar <em>A. afarensis</em> reconstruction from their collection.

Their photos are also available at their school's webpage, including <a href="http://www.dlt.ncssm.edu/tiger/360views/masterindex.htm">the ability to render them as 3-D rotations.</a>
