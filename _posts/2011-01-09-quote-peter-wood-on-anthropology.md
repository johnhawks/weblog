Peter Wood, in <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/were-samoans-promiscuous/27941">a review</a> of Paul Shankman's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0299234541?ie=UTF8&tag=johnhawksanth-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0299234541"><i>The Trashing of Margaret Mead: Anatomy of an Anthropological Controversy</i></a>: 

<blockquote>So which is it? The Mead vs. Freeman controversy doesnt look like it has much room for an in-between answer. Either Samoan teenagers of that time were free and easy with their sexuality or they were hemmed in by a social system that strongly repressed pre-marital sexual activity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anthropology as a science ought to be able to answer such a straightforward question. It says something about anthropology that the issue is still controversial 27 years after Freeman declared that Mead was provably wrong.</blockquote>
