<i>Washington Post</i>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804915.html">"Wide Web of diversions gets laptops evicted from lecture halls"</a>: 

<blockquote>Professors have banned laptops from their classrooms at George Washington University, American University, the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia, among many others. Last month, a physics professor at the University of Oklahoma poured liquid nitrogen onto a laptop and then shattered it on the floor, a warning to the digitally distracted. A student -- of course -- managed to capture the staged theatrics on video and drew a million hits on YouTube.</blockquote>

Whiners. 

All this does is privilege students with smaller devices in tablet form factor. I'd like to see the opposite story, about how computers are empowering new kinds of classroom experiences. 

Although there was that time that the student with the computer tried to "correct" me by citing Wikipedia in class. That led to a few minutes of entertainment for everyone!
