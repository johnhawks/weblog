Ottoline Leyser, "chairwoman of the Royal Society Science Policy Advisory Group," has published a brief essay on science assessment in the U.K.: <a href="http://www.researchresearch.com/news/article/?articleId=1366743">"No researchers should be submitted to the REF"</a>.

I wanted to share this paragraph from the essay, which was brought to my attention by Jennifer Rohn.

<blockquote>A high-quality research portfolio doesnâ€™t consist only of groundbreaking discoveries. It contains work that cements initial findings, integrates existing work, develops tools and resources such as databases, engages diverse groups and nurtures the next generation of researchers.</blockquote>

I live by this principle in all my projects and scientific work.
