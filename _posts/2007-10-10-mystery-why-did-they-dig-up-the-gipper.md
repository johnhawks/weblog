The proper forms were filed, and the family made the request, but <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21229795/">some of the Gipps are angry about it</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. - The body of George Gipp, the Notre Dame football player who inspired the rallying cry "Win one for the Gipper," was exhumed recently for DNA testing in his Upper Peninsula hometown.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is a very sensitive family matter," said [Mike] Bynum, of Birmingham, Ala., who described himself as a close friend of Gipp's closest living relatives. He said they did not want to comment but would issue a statement in the future.</blockquote>

Very curious. Curious enough for ESPN to send a film crew, anyway. I wonder if there's a little lost Gipper out there...
