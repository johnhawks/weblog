Brian Switek <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/06/a_date_with_lucy_and_ida_too.php">reviews the "Lucy's Legacy" exhibit</a>, now in New York: 

<blockquote>Replicas of Lucy do not do justice to the real bones. The way the dim lighting glinted off her worn molars, the curvature of her finger bone, the shape of her astragalus ... I had never appreciated these things before. It is a good thing the glass case was there, because I had the urge to pick up the fossils and examine them from other angles. </blockquote>

I appreciate the description and discussion of the Viktor Deak mural (<a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/profiles/viktor-deak-artist-profile-nytimes-2009.html">Deak profiled last month</a>).
