If you haven't had your fill of angsty petulance, then Scienceblogs and its stable of writers have been wading through Edward versus Jacob territory. <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2010/07/pz-myers-will-reveal-his-decision-on.html">Jonathan Eisen's parody</a> leverages the <i>other</i> summer drama, LeBron's departure from Cleveland:

<blockquote>Morris, MN  For the final act of the drama that has captured the imagination of science blogging fans around the world, PZ Myers of Pharyngula plans to announce his decision live on the Discovery Channel at 9 on Thursday night.

The arrangement, first reported by Discovery, was confirmed by a person close to Myers, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on Myers behalf.</blockquote>
