For folks in the San Diego / Southern California area, I'm going to be at a symposium at the Salk Institute this Friday and Saturday. The Friday portion is open to the public, and it includes some great speakers -- here's a schedule: 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Origin and Fate of Neanderthals</b>

<b>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</b><br />
DeHoffmann Auditorium

</p>

<p>

<p>
This is really a stellar lineup for a public symposium, representing some of the most cutting edge research on Neandertals. That's one reason to go if you are in the neighborhood. 
</p>

<p>
Another reason is moral support -- hey, I'm the junior participant by a lot! I need all the help I can get! It will help gird me up for the <i>closed door session</i> on Saturday!
</p>

<p>
Oh, and if you need one more reason? Remember all that stuff I haven't been blogging about? You know, the stuff that it stretches all logic to think that I wouldn't have <i>some</i> opinion about, but somehow the blog is completely silent? 
</p>

<p>
Well....
</p>
