<p>
With apologies to <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/">James Taranto</a>, this from <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/treatment-developed-for-patients-with-medically-unexplained-symptoms-10981.html">Science Blog</a> caught my eye:
</p>

<blockquote>Doctors at Michigan State University have developed a revolutionary treatment plan that will allow primary care physicians to more effectively treat people who suffer from medically unexplained symptoms.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The diagnosis of medically unexplained symptoms is a problem that affects millions of people and can tax an already over-burdened health care system, according to Robert Smith, a physician and professor in MSU's Department of Medicine, College of Human Medicine.</blockquote>

<p>
Am I the only one who finds it humorous that Robert Smith has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_cure">The Cure</a>?
