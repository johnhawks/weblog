I really like this blog post reviewing the discovery of botulinum toxin by Rebecca Kreston: <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bodyhorrors/2016/07/31/bad-sausage-botulism/#.V6DpL2BwNaE">"The Bad Sausage & The Discovery of Botulism"</a>. 

<blockquote>Two years later, he published a second monograph chronicling the outcomes of 155 cases, speculating on the mechanism of what he would dub “the fat poison.” Kerner administered extracts of spoiled sausage mixed with honey to a menagerie of small captured animals – including flies, locusts, snails, birds, frogs, rabbits, and cats – finding identical presentations of “sausage poisoning” in fly and frog alike (2). He also made small incisions in the thighs of a rabbit and cat, daubing the exposed tissue with sausage extracts and found that the “fat poison” brought about a localized paralytic effect with complete recovery of the animals. Kerner also poisoned himself. Placing just a few scant drops of extract on his tongue, he noticed a “feeling of contraction and choking in the area of the larynx … some drops of the acid brought onto the tongue cause great drying out of the palate and the pharynx.”(2) The extract tasted sour, much like the spoiled sausages.</blockquote>

All of this unfolded in the 1820s.
