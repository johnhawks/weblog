Sabine Hossenfelder gives some useful advice about <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.ca/2013/08/should-you-write-science-blog.html">"Should you write a science blog?"</a>. 

<blockquote>Advice #8: Dont be afraid of your readers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If everybody would like what you write, somebody would hate it just because everybody likes it, so its futile. If Ive learned one thing from blogging, its that misunderstandings are unavoidable. Theyre part of the process and thats a two-way process. Just dont take hits frontally, use their momentum. That misunderstanding really makes a good topic for your next blogpost, no?</blockquote>

I also like this: "But dont think you actually have to be a good writer. Because most likely your readers arent good readers either, which is only fair."
