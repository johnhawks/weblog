Some of you may have tried the site yesterday or this morning and found an ad farm trying to sell you "John Hawks brake pads". 
</p>

<p>
This is not my new calling. Although a few more human-chimpanzee divergence dates, and I may chuck it all!
</p>

<p>
My domain registrar went into meltdown and was unable to process renewals, just as mine needed renewing. Something about the three guys running the company trying to get each other arrested.  
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I'm one of the lucky few whose domain was <i>actually</i> managed by another company, and I've been able to "push" my domain to a safe account. So everything is back to normal. The new DNS settings may take a while to percolate through the internet, but otherwise we're in good shape.

<p>
What a mess!
