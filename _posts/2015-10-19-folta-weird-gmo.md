This is so weird: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/brookeborel/when-scientists-email-monsanto">"Seed Money: How Kevin Folta got entangled with Monsanto, created a shady podcast alter ego, and spurred a hot public debate over conflicts of interest in big ag."</a>. The bizarre part is Folta's pseudonymous podcast: 

<blockquote>The email conversation that followed was decidedly odd. Yes, Folta was Blazek. He was using a pseudonym, he said, because it was fun (“I see why Colbert did the Colbert Report”), and so he could “play in this space” without drawing attention to his role in the project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, he had interviewed himself, but only because some of his listeners had caught on that Blazek might be him, and he wanted to throw them off his trail. And, well, no, he hadn’t considered how all this might look to an outsider.</blockquote>

Talk about self-inflicted damage to one's own credibility.
