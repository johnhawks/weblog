I've had this Buzzfeed article sitting on my stack for two months: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/timstelloh/the-hunter-the-hoaxer-and-the-battle-over-bigfoot#.ykBeZlWG1">"The Hunter, The Hoaxer, And The Battle Over Bigfoot"</a>. For people interested in biological anthropology, this is essential reading. The story is a remarkable picture of a subculture that most scientists are only vaguely aware exists. 

The article has a very sympathetic profile of Jeffrey Meldrum, an Idaho State University anthropologist who has worked to make Sasquatch into a legitimate scientific inquiry. But the most amazing parts relate to Rick Dyer, whom the article presents as "an admitted serial hoaxer with a chameleon-like ability to cultivate a new persona for each gambit". The article relates a series of Dyer's unforgettable attempts to fool the gullible, or to gull fools, as you prefer.
