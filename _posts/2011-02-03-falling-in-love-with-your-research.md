Matt Wedel of SV-POW gives advice on <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/tutorial-12-how-to-find-problems-to-work-on/">"How to find problems to work on"</a>. 

<blockquote>I dont describe this as falling in love lightly. Thats what it feels like: a positive feedback loop wherein the more you engage with a subject, the more you enjoy engaging with it, and so on. A few rounds of that and you may find yourself in a committed relationship, also known as a research program, because thats how you maximize your time with the object of your affection.</blockquote>

The whole series of tutorials on research is useful, many of them cover the difficulties engaging with research as an outsider to academia.
