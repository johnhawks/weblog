Hunter R. Rawlings, in <em>Inside HIgher Ed</em>: <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/30/essay-research-universities-must-pay-more-attention-student-learning#ixzz1qkKQceaq">"Why Research Universities Must Change"</a>.

<blockquote>The professionalization of the professoriate has been crucially beneficial for research and graduate training at many institutions, but at most large universities, it has been problematic for undergraduate education. Several recent studies, some flawed but still indicative, have revealed that a significant percentage of students do not improve their critical thinking and writing much at all in the first two years of college. This should come as no surprise, given the dearth of small classes requiring active participation and intellectual interaction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Too many students are adrift in a sea of courses having little to do with one another.  Many courses, even at the upper division level, have no prerequisites, and many require no debate or public speaking or the writing of papers that receive close attention and correction.  A students curriculum is a mlange of courses drawn almost haphazardly from dozens of discrete academic departments.  And there is substantial evidence that students are fleeing demanding majors in favor of easier ones that have the added lure of appearing to promise immediate access to jobs.</blockquote>
