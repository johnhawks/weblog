I just saw <a href="http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2050607.004">the Bionic Concept Vehicle</a> from Mercedes-Benz. It's design in based on a boxfish, which turns out to be highly aerodynamic although it looks ungainly. The car also uses liquid urea solution to cut down the emissions--it's not a catalytic converter, it's a kidney! Very cool application of biology in design.

Will people drive a car that looks like it belongs on a coral reef? It looks cool to me, but a little like a SMART car -- something that doesn't look like it would be as great to drive on the highway, but perfect if you stay in town. But then Europe gets all those kinds of cars, and they never show up here. Still, at 70 miles per gallon...
