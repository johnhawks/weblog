I can't get over the subhead of <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28057748/">this story about a new car-sized pterosaur</a>: 

<blockquote><b>Discovery of toothless predator has forced the creation of a new genus</b></blockquote>

Imagine! <b>"Forced"</b> to create a new genus! 

Oh, I know it's just a figure of speech. But maybe I could get a phone number that would force paleoanthropologists to <i>destroy</i> some genera? Maybe we could arrange an exchange program with the dinosaurs?
