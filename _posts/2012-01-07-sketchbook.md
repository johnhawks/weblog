KNM-ER 1802 mandible, in occlusal view. This mandible is attributed to the genus <em>Homo</em>, often placed in <em>Homo habilis</em>, although those who believe in <em>Homo rudolfensis</em> generally include this mandible. From the Upper Burji Member of the Koobi Fora Formation, it dates to around 1.9 million years ago.
