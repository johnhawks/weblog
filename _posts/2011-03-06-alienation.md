On the issue of alien cyanobacteria, I recommend David Dobbs: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/aliens-riding-meteorites-arsenic-redux-or-something-new/">"Aliens riding meteorites: Arsenic redux or something new?"</a> 

UPDATE (2011-03-06): Also Rosie Redfield, <a href="http://rrresearch.blogspot.com/2011/03/is-this-claim-of-bacteria-in-meteorite.html">"Is this claim of bacteria in a meteorite any better than the 1996 one?"</a> (short answer, no).
