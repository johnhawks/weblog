<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2010/09/announcing-plos-blogs/"><i>PLoS</i> now has blogs.</a> The announcement accentuates that they have an equal representation of scientists and science journalists. 

<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuroanthropology/">Neuroanthropology</a>, authored by Daniel Lende and Greg Downey, will be of interest to many of my readers. John Rennie also has a "plog" as they're calling them, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/retort/">"The Gleaming Retort"</a>. <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakeasyscience/">"Speakeasy Science"</a>, by University of Wisconsin journalism professor Deborah Blum, has made the jump to PLoS as well.
