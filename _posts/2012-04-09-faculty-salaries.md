The <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> reports on faculty salaries in a fascinating way: <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/faculty-salaries-table-2012/131433">"Interactive Table: Average Faculty Salaries, 201112"</a>. This is good information for people on the job market, although the data are not specific to discipline and anthropologists are low-paid relative to the sciences and other social sciences. For example, I make around $50,000 less than the average assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 

UPDATE (2012-04-09): S. J. Esposito writes <a href="http://sjespositoweblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/lectures-being-ripped-from-wikipedia-what-gives/">"Lectures being ripped from Wikipedia..? What gives?"</a>

<blockquote>Ive noticed, on three separate occasions, that a substantial portion of certain lectures that Im receiving in certain classes are coming nearly directly from Wikipedia articles on the same topics. This, obviously, is highly disappointing to meIm studying to gain access to information that I thought was, at least partially, original and not available to anyone with an internet connection. Instead, it seems Im sitting through an hour and ten minutes of a lengthy explanation and over-complication of standard Wiki articles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The number of dollars that these folks make will make your jaw drop. And for a minute, I sat back in my chair, whilst looking at the ripped-off lecture slides that I was reviewing, and realized that there is definitely a problem here.</blockquote>
