<em>Time</em> magazine reveals that Neandertal genetics can confer a risk of method acting:

<blockquote>So why is Leto so weird? We learn that, based on the results of a genetic test, Leto can claim a rather different gene makeup than most of us. “I have a lot of Neanderthal in me,” he told Rolling Stone. “Maybe that’s why I’m so good at climbing.” Among other things.</blockquote>

That's from a <a href="http://time.com/4427272/a-brief-history-of-things-modern-neanderthal-jared-leto-has-done-to-get-in-character/">profile of actor Jared Leto</a>, soon to be on screens as the Joker in <em>Suicide Squad</em>.
