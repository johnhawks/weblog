So said the excavation team led by Li Zhanyang, working the site of Xuchang, in Henan province, China, just last month. And <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-01/23/content_6413831.htm">then they did</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>The pieces of the human skull showed up just when archaeologists were going home for the Spring Festival.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It was freezing cold and digging was difficult. We planned to leave the next day when one of us saw something like part of a human skull," said Li.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It was 9 am, and only an hour earlier we joked and said: 'Let's get a skull today'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And there it was."</blockquote>

<p>
There's no publication on the cranium, this is just a press announcement of their discovery. Most of the articles are running with this picture, courtesy of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage:

It will be nice to see it put together. This is a tremendously important time period, during which there are only a handful of human fossils from East Asia.

<p>
This detail made it into a number of stories: 
</p>

<blockquote>The fossil consisted of 16 pieces of the skull with protruding eyebrows and a small forehead. More astonishing than the completeness of the skull is that it still has a fossilized membrane on the inner side, so scientists can track the nerves of the Paleolithic ancestors, Li said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The pieces were fossilized because they were buried 5 m near the mouth of a spring, whose water had a high content of calcium.</blockquote>

<p>
I suppose that must mean one (or more) of the arachnoid membranes had calcified on the inside table of the cranial bone, but we'll have to wait and see.
