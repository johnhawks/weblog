<p>
I got slammed with crazy demand after the Neandertal genome stuff came out today. I will be updating later today with more information, including an FAQ. 
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I will be moving the site intermittently to the backup server. This is notably suboptimal, I know, because it will be static-rendered so lots of stuff won't work properly. The next step, if it becomes necessary, will be to cut down the content so that the Neandertal pages will load for more people. 
</p>

<p>
So if you are new to the site and exploring for the first time, please forgive me if things aren't working properly.
</p>

<p>
The regular server will be back online full time by tonight or tomorrow. I want to thank everybody very heartily for taking the time to stop by!
