<blockquote>I just watched
one of your lectures, 'Legs', which you've put up on your blog - and I
had to let you know that I enjoyed it immensely.

Thanks for putting it up and for letting me have a peek into your
classroom. I hope you will continue to put up videos like this.</blockquote>

Thank you so much for letting me know!

I'm still getting the hang of the system, so I expect some of the lectures will be a lot better than this one!
