<p>
I ran across <a href="http://www.dna-rainbow.org/">the DNA Rainbow</a> project today. A couple of guys compiled images based on the human genome sequence, where each pixel is a base and the different bases are different colors. 
</p>

<p>
The closeups where you can see the static of the different colors are sort of like those "Magic Eye" posters. More interesting are the zoomed-out versions that show an entire chromosome at a time. At that scale, each pixel is a blend of lots of local variation, and you can see soft color stripes that correspond to GC-rich regions and the like. 
</p>

<p>
They might make a good illustrations for classes!
