<strong>Notable:</strong> Bocherens, Herv√©, Martin Cotte, Ricardo A. Bonini, Pablo Straccia, Daniel Scian, Leopoldo Soibelzon, Francisco J. Prevosti. 2017. Isotopic insight on paleodiet of extinct Pleistocene megafaunal Xenarthrans from Argentina. <em>Gondwana Research</em> (in press). <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2017.04.003">doi:10.1016/j.gr.2017.04.003</a>

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Bocherens and colleagues did stable isotopic sampling of bones and teeth from extinct sabertooths, horses, and various extinct xenarthrans including glyptodonts and giant ground sloths. The sabertooths obviously turned out like modern carnivores in their stable isotopes. The extinct megafaunal xenarthrans looked just like modern herbivores, with no sign of the in-between diet of some modern species that rely on insect-eating or occasional scavening, like armadillos.

<strong>Interesting because:</strong> Some paleoecologists had suggested that these weird-looking extinct species might, in addition to eating plants, have been part-time scavengers, or have relied on insect consumption. That is, they might have been a bit more like bears than elephants. That proves not to be the case in any significant way, at least for the South American extinct species sampled.

<strong>Best line:</strong> "Therefore <em>Megatherium</em> is not the cryptic flesh-eater suggested by some authors that could have accounted for the supposed imbalance of carnivores in the South American megafauna."
