Most of these problems have been evident for a long time, especially the unsustainability of frequent short-term travel, and the lack of investment in scientific infrastructure and human capital in developing nations. In this article, I worked with many archaeologists, geologists, and other field-based scientists to describe these problems and suggest steps toward solutions.</p>"

Garrison. <em>American Journal of Human Genetics</em> 107(2): 183--195.</p><hr /><p>I'm proud to have contributed to this working paper that has been adopted as guidance by the American Society of Human Genetics Board of Directors. As ancient DNA has grown in importance, we must continue to center the collaborations with communities that make it possible to pursue meaningful research about the past. Many thanks especially to Jen Wagner and Nanibaa’ Garrison for their leadership on this issue. </p>"

    title: "Sexual dimorphism of the relationship between the gut and pelvis in humans"
    excerpt: "<p>Jeanelle Uy, John Hawks, and Caroline VanSickle. <em>American Journal of Physical Anthropology</em> e24084.</p><hr /><p>Many researchers in human evolution have been interested in the idea that early hominins may have had large guts for digesting poor-quality diets. They have thought that the large pelvis size of hominins like <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> might reflect gut size, because the pelvis supports the gut in bipeds like humans. But almost nobody had looked to see whether pelvis size gives any predictive value about gut size in humans or other primates. Jeanelle's research shows that in men the pelvis-gut size relation is entirely explained by body size, with no significant relationship in women. In fact men and women vary in opposite directions, which puts the idea of estimating ancient hominin gut sizes in a different light.</p>"

Our chapter discusses a few of the questions that underlie our current research in the Rising Star cave system, including questions about how to understand evidence of behavior in the multi-hominin context of Middle Pleistocene Africa.</p>"

    excerpt: "<p>Debra R. Bolter, Marina C. Elliott, John Hawks, and Lee R. Berger. <em>PLoS ONE</em> 15(4): e0230440.</p><hr /><p>The Rising Star fossil assemblages provide some of the richest evidence of immature hominin remains, with at least 10 juvenile individuals. In the Dinaledi Chamber, our team is working to reconstruct the puzzle of the site by finding which bones and fragments belong to individual children. This paper describes a partial skeleton with postcranial and mandibular elements. As this evidence continues to build, we will be able to build a solid picture of growth and development in this species.</p>"
