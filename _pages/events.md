    excerpt: "I hosted Discovery Channel presenter Josh Gates in my laboratory in Madison to chat about the fossil evidence of human origins. Then, I joined him remotely from South Africa. This 2-part episode, which also visited my friend Charles Musiba at Laetoli, Tanzania and Dominic Stratford at Sterkfontein, gave a neat chance to bring some recent discoveries to viewers around the U.S."

    title: "American Society of Human Genetics, October 2018"
    excerpt: "In 2018, I was invited to organize the Presidential Symposium at the American Society of Human Genetics. This was a wonderful event devoted to African genetics and prehistory, with featured speakers Ambroise Wonkam from the University of Cape Town and Himla Soodyall of the University of the Witwatersrand. It was inspiring to bring new research across the spectrum of genetics and archaeology to this audience of more than 5000 human geneticists. My address at the symposium focused on the interaction of new discoveries in the fossil and archaeological records with new DNA research on living and ancient people."
