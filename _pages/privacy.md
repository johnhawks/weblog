I care about the privacy of all visitors to this site. This Privacy Policy informs visitors which information is recorded when they visit the site.  

My own scripts and web pages do not record any information from visitors. I do not take e-mail addresses or any personal information. 

I use Google Analytics to report on how many people visit the website and how they interact with it. When your browser loads a page, information is sent to Google. This tool uses cookies and web beacons that do not convey any identifying information about individual visitors to me or this site. <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a> outlines how Google uses this information.

This site is hosted on Github, using their Github Pages service. Github's servers collect technical information on visitors to this site, including IP addresses and browser information. The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">Github Privacy Statement</a> outlines how the organization uses information. Github's statement encompasses many different services including those that have Github account information, which is not necessary for reading and interacting with this website. 

This website collects no information other than what Github's servers and Google Analytics collect. 

This Privacy Policy is posted to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I am happy to have all the international readers of this site, and want to make clear that I do not retain or use any personal information from any visitors.
